### Before we Begin

Note:
Now, some points of order:  
If you have something to say while I’m speaking, feel free to raise your hand until I notice you. I have few points to stop between each section where I’ll call on to you to bring forward your comment or your question. Depending on where we are, I’ll either answer it right away, or make a note of it and come back to it later.  
This session is 90 minutes and we a ton of things to cover. So, I’ve asked for permission that we’ll be moving the questions and discussion for this talk to the Birds of Feather session later this afternoon. I’m, very much, looking forward to that.  
If you have any thoughts or comments about this later on, you can always talk to me while we’re here at TechTrek, or later over email or on the new Q&A site.  
Through out the session, feel free to go out or come in at any time. Please try to be quite and mindful of the other attendees.  
Finally, I ask that you switch your phones to silent. Relax, and hopefully enjoy the show. Thank you!
