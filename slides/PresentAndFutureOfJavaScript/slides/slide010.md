### Before we Start

Note:
Alright, thanks everyone for being here. I hope you’re all having fun this week. There are lots of sessions to learn a ton of new and important technologies and techniques, I hope you’re finding it useful as much as I do.  
In this talk, I’ll try to do something a bit different. I’ll try to tell a story. I’m hoping it’ll make sense, it’ll get you thinking a bit, and as with any good story, that it’ll be entertaining.  
Of course, like any story, some things are marginalized or brought into focus for dramatic effect which is to say that this talk will have some opinions. This is on purpose to start a conversation, and get everyone involved.  
Now some quick disclaimers: I’m only speaking on my behalf. This story and everything in this talk only represents my views, for better or for worse. It doesn’t represent the views of my employer, if you will. This disclaimer is obvious to me, but I wanted to make sure it’s obvious for everyone.  
Also, while we’re stating the obvious, what you’re about to see is a summation of lots and lots of reading, learning, and work of other people whom I tried my best to credit in the resources I’ll be provided at the end of these slides. So, it’s not like I invented anything, other than this narrative and these slides.
