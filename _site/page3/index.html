        Using Intellisense with Esri’s JavaScript API in Visual Studio
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Mar 2013</span>

    <p>We all love Intellisense in Visual Studio, but with JavaScript is a little difficult to do that given it’s a dynamic language. However, most JavaScript libraries now comes with VSDoc files that provide a way to add intellisense to JavaScript in Visual Studio (and other IDEs). 
This <a href="http://blog.craigtp.co.uk/post/Javascript-jQuery-Intellisense-in-Visual-Studio-2012.aspx">post</a> describe how to add the VSDoc files of any JavaScript library to your project in Visual Studio (Some of the images in this post are from <a href="http://blog.craigtp.co.uk/post/Javascript-jQuery-Intellisense-in-Visual-Studio-2012.aspx">here</a>). In this post, I’ll expand on that to add intellisense for the Esri JavaScript API (JSAPI). 
First, download the VSDoc file for the JSAPI from <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/jshelp/jsapi_vsdoc12_v33.zip">here</a> (direct link to Zip file). Updated version of the file could be found <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/jsapi/#api_codeassist">here</a>. 
Thanks to <span class="usertitle"><a href="http://forums.arcgis.com/members/1411-kenbuja">Ken Buja</a> who provided the updated file on <a href="http://forums.arcgis.com/threads/78957-Is-the-VSDoc-for-JSAPI-Up-to-Date">Esri JSAPI forum</a>.</span></p>

<h3 id="visual-studio-2012">Visual Studio 2012</h3>
<p>Open the Options Dialog  </p>

<p><img src="/public/images/JsapiIntellisense/1-OpenOptionsDialog.png" alt="Open Options Dialog" />  </p>

<p>Under Text Editor &gt; JavaScript &gt; Intellisense &gt; References, switch to Implicit (Web) in the drop down list, and make sure that “~/Scripts/_references.js” is added. </p>

<p><img src="/public/images/JsapiIntellisense/2-PrepareJsReferences.png" alt="Prepare Javascript References" />  </p>

<p>This will tell Visual Studio that in any project, you will place a file named “_references.js” under a folder named “Scripts” at the root of the project, and in that file you will add references to the JavaScript API files with intellisense. You can change the file name or folder to anything you like. </p>

<p>Now, let’s add the _references.js file. Add a new item under the Scripts folder. </p>

<p><img src="/public/images/JsapiIntellisense/3-AddNewItem.png" alt="Add New File" />  </p>

<p>Then, name the new file _references.js </p>

<p><img src="/public/images/JsapiIntellisense/4-AddReferencesFile.png" alt="Add Reference File" />  </p>

<p>In the new file, add references to the VSDoc file you included in your project. You can simply drag the file from the Solution Explorer and drop it on to the file. </p>

<p><img src="/public/images/JsapiIntellisense/5-ContentOfReferenceFile.png" alt="Content of Reference File" />  </p>

<p>You can see in this file, I’ve added references to jQuery, SignalR, and the JSAPI. 
Now, you’ll get intellisense in your JavaScript file. </p>

<p><img src="/public/images/JsapiIntellisense/6-EsriJsApiIntellisenseVS2012.png" alt="Intellisense in VS 2012" />  </p>

<h3 id="visual-studio-2010">Visual Studio 2010</h3>
<p>In Visual Studio 2010, there’s no section in Options to add a reference to the _references.js file. So, you’ll need to add a reference to that file in each file you’re working on. </p>

<p><img src="/public/images/JsapiIntellisense/7-AddingReferenceFileInVS2010.png" alt="Adding Reference File in VS 2010" />  </p>

<p>You’ll get the same results.        </p>

<p><img src="/public/images/JsapiIntellisense/8-EsriJsApiIntellisenseVS2010.png" alt="Intellisense in VS 2010" />  </p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I’ve updated the links to VSDoc file to the latest version.</p>

    <span class="post-date">16 Sep 2012</span>

    <p><img class="imageOnRight" title="Cloud" src="/public/images/PersonalClouds/CloudIcon.png" />
“The Cloud is coming”. Actually, it’s more like “The cloud is here”. It’s being forced upon us on every platform (Almost every platform, at least, Windows, OSX, iOS, Ubuntu and Android). With the spread of smartphones, the cloud now not only makes sense but is also useful. </p>

<p>Let me go back a step to make a distinction. 
There are two meanings for the word “The Cloud”: </p>

<ul>
  <li>One is common in IT departments, although not very popular, I assume. Think Amazon Cloud Services, and Windows Azure. We’ll call it the Cloud.</li>
  <li>The other is common between end users. Think iCloud, SkyDrive and Office Web Apps. This is more like Cloud Services; it’s services that live in the Cloud.</li>
</ul>

<p>Only an advancement in the first made the second possible. Giant software companies are now building these huge data centers that can be used in a very efficient way. Unlike before, when renting a server meant that you actually were allocated a physical server (or a folder on a server) in a certain data center. Those days, if the machine stopped, or the data center lost power that meant that your web site went offline. Now, your web application is hosted in a Virtual Machine that – along with 1000s or other VMs – form a layer between you and the physical server. Now, the server – or even the data center – can go offline and your application would still continue. Maybe with few minutes of downtime if you were running a single instance of VM.</p>

<p>Another advancement that is directly affecting these cloud services is the spread of smartphones and tablets. These cloud services play one of two roles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Back-end to an application that runs on two different devices and shares state through the cloud. The simplest example is a text editor running on your phone modifying a file on Dropbox. Every time you modify the file, it get synced to your computer where you can continue your edits using a different text editor. These are two different applications running on two different devices, yet they’re sharing the state of the data they’re manipulating.</li>
  <li>Server-side application available on multiple platforms. Think Evernote. You can access it through your phone, your desktop client, any web browser. You think it’s the same application which technically is not true. There’s a web application, maybe written in Ruby. A Windows client that could written in .NET. An iPhone app written in Objective-C. These are three different application that share state through Evernote’s servers but more importantly they share a lot of backend services like OCR, search, archiving, and other. That’s why you consider it one application. That’s why it’s one application.</li>
</ul>

<p>In either case (and they’re very similar) the cloud is extremely useful. Being able to move seamlessly from one device to another is incredible and we’re just starting. In few years, we should be able to move from one device to another for a much larger number of applications that we do now. As more applications is built directly to the cloud, compared to now where web applications are modified to include these capabilities.
While the cloud offer a great capability to users, it offers even bigger advantages to big software companies. They now control your digital life. I spent the last five years of my life writing all these tiny tweets, 140-characters at a time, all 36,000+ of them. Now, I can’t get them back. Twitter has sucked them into a void. They won’t let me download them. They won’t let me search them. They won’t let me even browse them. Meanwhile, Twitter is building this profile of my interests and feeding me all these ads about all the silly things I demonstrated that I care about.
I can’t get out of Twitter, I’ve invested five of years into it. I’ve built networks of friends. I need twitter more than they need me, it seems. When you cut off 3<sup>rd</sup> party developers, or block my favorite desktop client or change the terms of services; all are things I don’t agree of, but not enough to make me leave the service.
Same goes for many other services. After a while, there’s nothing you can do about changes to the service when you don’t agree of them. Google can change Google Reader by shutting down sharing, and force you to use Google+, but you won’t leave. Facebook can change their terms of service or privacy policy, and you would just click “I Accept”. Nothing you could do really.
Let me sum up what I see is the problem with these services in three – not so – brief points:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Privacy</strong>: your data is not just yours anymore. Your data can be mined, copied, passed to law enforcement, peaked at by bored employees, or stolen by hackers who are now shooting at larger targets.</li>
  <li><strong>Freedom</strong>: you may only run the features and functionality that are available and permitted by the software vendor. If the vendor upgrades the service to include more – or less – features, you have no choice to roll back to another version. If you’re using a feature that only few users like, that feature will likely be removed. Your online petition won’t really help bring it back. You may integrate this software with other services that are permitted by the software vendor. If there’s a service or functionality you’d like but is not available, you can’t easily build your own. You’re being handed fully cooked meals instead of ingredients you can put together to make something new.</li>
  <li><strong>Competition</strong>: these companies that are building full solutions are the ones in a better position to survive the competition. If you’re building a service that does only one thing, (I’m looking at you, Dropbox) you are at a worse position than your competitor whose building two things into their service (to follow on the example, iCloud and SkyDrive). <em>Integration</em>. Windows 8, and the whole family of new Windows products, is built on the promise of integration. Windows on your phone, Windows on your PC, Windows on your tablet, and Windows on your Game console and TV set. Companies that are building two features/things into their service have an incentive to make you use their new shinny third feature even though it’s much worse than the competition. They can integrate it better than the competition. Notice how ‘Files’ are taking a back seat in all these services. There are no files any more. On your phone, there are no files, there are only apps. People think of files are a pain to handle, because there are so many of them and you have to arrange them in folders and remember where you stored them. They are a pain. But files are very important because they allow for mobility of your data. Any application that can read this file is an application that you can move to. If one application does a certain feature that your default application doesn’t do, you can move to it as long as it can read that file format. Some applications use proprietary file formats but eventually open standard file format tend to dominate. With apps, you can’t move from one app to another because there are no files. You’re stuck with that app.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can look at these problems and think that they’re not very important or that you don’t affect you very much or even think that it’s a natural advancement or how computers work now. I see them as warning signs.
There must be a solution.
I consider the benefits of the cloud and cloud services to be huge. It’s something that you can’t live without once you get used to it. Living off the cloud is not an option.
At its core, the cloud is a computer that is always on running a certain piece of software. Actually it’s some number of computers running each with a specific software. I have a Dropbox computer, a Gmail computer, a twitter computer, and so on. If I can get these pieces of software to run on my machine, and make that machine available online and accessible to my phone and other devices then I would have my own cloud.
What I need is a Virtual Machine, only accessible to me (or any service/person I give and control permission to), that is running a server-side operating system and a software that replaces each service I’m using. It would have an email server, a calendar, a cloud storage service, a synchronization service, a node of social media, a blog, a Wiki, and any other type of cloud service I’m using.
There are alternatives to a lot of the services that any user is using daily. Instead of <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>, use your own <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>. Instead of <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">Gmail</a>, use <a href="http://www.smartertools.com/smartermail/mail-server-software.aspx">SmarterMail</a>, <a href="http://www.zimbra.com/">Zimbra</a>, or <a href="http://www.sendmail.com/sm/open_source/">Sendmail</a>. Instead of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, use <a href="http://www.tonido.com/">Tonido</a> or <a href="http://sparkleshare.org/">SparkleShare</a>. Instead of <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> or <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a>, use <a href="http://theopenphotoproject.org/">OpenPhoto</a>. </p>

<p>There are few services that doesn’t have great alternatives but they can be built.
For such proposal to work, <strike>two</strike> three key issues have to be addressed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Ease of Management</strong>: 
in any cloud service, all you need to manage the service is sign up. You don’t need to worry about updates, maintenance or troubleshooting any problems. Running your own cloud will definitely come a certain level of trouble. Think taking a cab vs. owning a car. It shouldn’t be so much pain. It should be relatively easy at least for techies in the beginning. With all these years of software development experience, it should be possible now to build a piece of software that is possible to troubleshoot by a non-techie. A dashboard with shiny gauges and handles should show status and allow control of these services.</li>
  <li><strong>Integration</strong>: 
these alternatives, that I’ve listed some of above, are built in isolation but they shouldn’t stay that way. They should integrate to offer a complete solution. Either by bridges that are small pieces of software that makes one service communicate with another without being aware of it, or by all these services adhering to a standard API to perform most common tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile Support</strong>: 
one of the main reasons of having a always-available service is to be able to access from your smartphone. Support for smartphones is a must for any cloud service, commercial or personal. This support can be through web or native apps, depending on the kind of service consumed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Frankly, I don’t know what to make of this idea. I’m certainly not the first to come forward with some sort of proposal for a Personal Cloud. I’m aware of at least one other proposal (by <a href="https://twitter.com/windley">@windley</a>) which can be found <a href="http://www.windley.com/cloudos/">here</a> but it’s more of a complete platform for personal clouds that require building a new type of operating system. Promising idea but strikes more as a Computer Science project rather than a piece of software than can be built and used in the near future.
I think this could be a big project that brings together all the pieces of open source projects together in one proposal that stands side by side with current offers from Apple, Microsoft and Google. Not only that it would an alternative, but also it would be good for software and for the benefit of users.</p>

<p>Update: Earlier version of this post didn’t included Mobile Support as a key issue to be addressed when building personal clouds.</p>

        EgyGeeks: on Building an Online Community
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2012</span>

    <p><img class="imageOnRight" title="EgyGeeks" src="/public/images/EgyGeeks/EgyGeeksLogo.png" /></p>

<p>A little over two years ago, a group of techies got together for a Skype conversation. Mohamed Meligy tells <a href="http://gurustop.net/blog/2010/04/05/join-the-egyptian-geeks-on-skype-weekly/">the story</a>. <em>It was a great talk and we really enjoyed it</em>, he says and I remember.</p>

<p>What started as a group of people “geeking out” on Skype transformed into something that is a little bit more. “Let’s have some sessions where someone tells us about a topic they know”, someone said and it so it was. It continued for a while. There are few things I think I learnt from that phase:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>It Takes Time</strong>: one sessions seems like it wasn’t that good, the next one didn’t have a big audience, don’t worry about it. Just keep going. You’re doing good. Effort + Time + Learn from mistakes = Better Results.</li>
  <li><strong>An Online Community is Different from an Offline Community</strong>: I gave one of these sessions, and it was one of most difficult longest sessions I gave; it was my first online session. When I’m in front of an audience, I keep going and build on their feedback. Start with a joke, they laugh then I can try another, they don’t then it’s information from then on. I can see when they’re bored, when they’re interested, when they’re just lost. I can do some course correction and damage control along the way. In an online session, I don’t have any of that feedback, it’s one long hour of me just talking. They could be rolling on the floor laughing at my jokes, and I wouldn’t know about it. They could be surfing the web, and I’d be thinking “Oh, I’m kicking ass today”. Online communities by their nature are different from offline communities. They’re not offline communities plus the convenience of availability, asynchronous communication, and never ending memory. They look the same, but they’re not the same. Pay attention to that.</li>
  <li><strong>Lots of Silent Participants</strong>: A lot of people will attend and be part of your community and not say anything. Don’t make them feel bad that they’re not participating and don’t make them feel like they have to participate. These are your audience. They are what makes your community possible. If not for them, you’d be just a guy talking. Also, you’re not smarter than them. You just feeling like talking and they don’t. When you get a chance to hear from them, you’ll see that they have a lot to add.</li>
  <li><strong>Logistics are a Pain</strong>: A lot of time went into finding free tools that we can use to hold online meetings. There’s a lot of tools, but you’re looking for a specific set of features that match your needs and you have to give up some of these because none of them have all of what you’re looking for.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over time, those who are more vocal in their participation wanted to make this online gatherings into a community. <a href="http://www.egygeeks.net/">EgyGeeks</a>, we would call it, and lots of activities would be part of it.</p>

<p>One activity stood out as: long lasting, easy to start, and kinda cool is podcasting. In the Arab tech world, there’s one podcast that I know of: <a href="http://www.DotNetArabi.com">Dot Net Arabi</a> for the always-delightful <a href="https://twitter.com/EmadAshi">Emad Alashi</a> who’s done a great job of maintaining that podcast. He models it after the <a href="http://hanselminutes.com/">Hanselmintues</a> podcast for <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman/">Scott Hanselman</a>. It’s short to-the-point interview with a developer and is strictly about specifics of technology. “You’re here to learn something” is the idea.</p>

<p>We wanted to offer something a bit different. Less of technology specific, or about technology specifics, and more of a community building exercise. Less about “what we do” and more about “how we do it”. There’s a lot of good developers in Egypt. There’s a lot of mediocre developers who can be good if given the chance. But one thing I’m sure of is: there’s a bad software industry in Egypt (and in the Arab world by extent). Wrong practices, bad motivations and incentives, and no meaningful community. (Individual exceptions exists, but they’re still exceptions, and individual). This podcast would be about replacing bad habits with good ones by informing people about what’s out there and how it’s possible, and how it relates to you as a local developer.</p>

<p>One idea that comes to mind when listening to one of these technology podcast is “Well, they work in Silicon valley” or “That’s not how we do it here” or whatever other idea brought to you by the inferiority complex in each of us. But if you start talking to other people, you’ll find that they have the same problems, they’re looking at the same solutions, they’re having the same obstacles, and in your conversations you can remove them. We’re willing to listen and participate of these American podcasts, and communities but not in our own and that should change.</p>

<p>A lot of thinking went into the format, length, style, and other aspects of the podcast. Let me tell you a little bit of what I learnt:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Format doesn’t matter, Style does</strong>: Format could be interview, circle of friends talking, host and circle of guests and friends, or else. This is not really that important. What’s important is the style of the conversation: it must be clear, obvious, inviting, to-the-point, easy to follow, and takes into account that there’s an audience. Feel free to use acronyms about the topic you’re talking about, just make sure to explain to the audience what it is. There’s one person listening who got annoyed by your exclusion of him, and will never listen to your podcast again. Don’t make inside jokes, invite everyone to enjoy the conversation as you are.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep It Short</strong>: I love long podcasts, I listen to <a href="http://twit.tv/ww">Windows Weekly</a> and <a href="http://twit.tv/twit">Twit</a>, and they sometime reach two hours per episode. Both great shows and made greater by the length of the show. I advocated a longer show (about an hour), everyone else said no, let’s make it 20-30 minutes. I thought of each episode to be a block of information and complete case about a certain topic, and they thought of the audience. Let me tell you, they were right and I was wrong. People listen to podcasts on their computer, and I listen on my cell phone when outside. People are busy, and I’m not. People dedicate a block of time to listen to a podcast while I multitask. I download the podcast and save it while people just stream it. Consider the audience, and you’re not necessarily representative of them.</li>
  <li><strong>Release Quickly, Release Often</strong>: I’ll use a software phrase to explain this point. Podcasting is like anything else. When you’re starting you don’t know anything about it. There’s no podcasting school. Learn from your mistakes, correct them, next time will be better. Just keep it steady, don’t say “we sucked last time, so I don’t feel like recording this week”. Say “we sucked last time because of _____, so this time we’ll fix it”.</li>
  <li><strong>Audio Quality, Audio Quality, Audio Quality</strong>: You can make a great podcast of background noise and inaudible discussion, but I’m not sure that’s what you’re audience is looking for.</li>
  <li><strong>Logistics are a Pain</strong>: They are. This includes recording, hosting, audio editing, publishing, getting the word out and coordinating a meeting time for people who live in four different time zones that span the earth (literally).</li>
</ul>

<p>This post comes after following a long <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/permalink/443626555677058/">Facebook thread</a> on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/egyptian.geeks/">Egyptian Geeks group</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/Bashmohandes/">Mohamed “Bashmohandes” Hossam</a>  discussing the idea of starting a podcast of their own which I think is a great idea. There was a discussion of what happened to EgyGeeks podcast. What happened simply is, the Arab Spring. Last EgyGeeks episode was published on January 20, 2011, five days before the revolution in Egypt. Since then, no one was really in the mood to geek out. We certainly weren’t. Things are now coming to a relative clam (I hope they are). We’re not committing to anything yet but before Ramadan we were discussing the idea of coming back. I hope this happens soon.</p>

      <a href="/AppStoreForTheRestOfUs">
        An App Store for the Rest of Us
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Jan 2012</span>

    <p>I’ve blogged a year ago about App Stores, calling that <a href="http://www.amreldib.com/2011/01/everybody-gets-app-store.html">everybody gets an App Store</a> or as Scott Hanselman <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/shanselman/status/144635686966919168">tweeted</a> it “There’s an App Store for that!”. I had hope for Microsoft to build a better app store that isn’t like Apple’s. So much for my hopes that were crushed when the details of Windows 8’s store was <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/microsoft-previews-windows-8-app-store-launching-with-the-beta-in-late-february/11340">revealed last month</a>. Microsoft <a href="http://www.winrumors.com/microsoft-promises-developers-a-bigger-bite-of-the-apple-with-its-windows-8-app-store/">promised developers a bigger bite</a> of the apple, bigger than Apple’s. 80% rather than 70%. Your app qualify for the bigger cut if your sales exceed 25,000$.</p>

<p>While that seems generous, I still didn’t like the phrase Microsoft used to describe taking a percentage of your revenue; “Revenue Sharing”.</p>

<iframe width="750" height="422" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/37E3jQIs2AA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Imagine the government re-labeling taxes as “Revenue Sharing”.</p>

<p>So, Microsoft creates a platform (if we can pass upgrading Windows as creating a new platform), announces that the only way you can get applications of that platform is through their app store and then takes away a percentage out of every single copy sold on that platform.</p>

<p>Imagine you’re a tiny shop building applications for Windows. Now, you want to switch your app that costs 10$ to the new Metro-style UI of Windows 8. How are you going to handle pricing? Are you giving up $3 to Microsoft and reducing your income by 30% or are you going to raise your price to make room for the new cost and piss off your customers who have seen price increase with no features to justify it which eventually will lead (at least some) customers to jump ship to other products.</p>

<p>Why is a 30% (or even 20%) cut out of every copy sold on Windows Store justified? Is Microsoft not making enough money from every single copy of Windows running on 90% of computers on the planet? Do they really need to have 30% share of the entire software revenue on top of Windows revenue.</p>

<p>What exactly justifies taking a 30% cut? Hosting the application, distributing updates, reviews capabilities, all these doesn’t justify taking a percentage of revenue. No, it’s the monopoly. “You wanna build an app for this platform, then we’ll share revenue”. It’s all part of the Apple-ification of Microsoft. Redmond has been lifting pages out of Apple’s playbook, but this time they’ve gone too far.</p>

<p>Apple has always used monopoly over its platform as a revenue generator. “Use our hardware”, “Use our software”, developers build little tools to add functionality to MacOS only to find Apple copy their ideas in the next release of the operating system and claim credit for it. Microsoft has always been unlike that. They celebrate partnership with other hardware and software vendors. They open up the chance for developers to build tools to cover up for Windows shortcomings. “Live and let live”. Not any more, it seems.</p>

<p>It’s also the “consumerization”. Putting the consumer first. Let business, power users and tech people take a back seat for a bit. The average Joe is the center of attention. He doesn’t want better software or more control, doesn’t care about customization, just make it easier and more shiny even with fewer functionality. Maybe it’s just me, but consumerization ruins general-purpose computation and PCs as we know it today. Consumerization turns PCs and Computers into appliances. One for each function. They deprive me from the ability to create and turn me into a consumer to whatever big companies give me.</p>

<p>I understand that this a lot to blame on an app store but it’s not the new functionality that bothers me. It’s the mentality with which it’s offered. An app store for Windows is a great feature that helps developers offer and distribute their applications. It’s been long over due. But Microsoft is taking the wrong approach to deliver this feature. If I were to build an app store for Windows, I would do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Make it a new way to get applications, not the only way</strong>: Users should choose to use an app store because it’s better not because it’s the only way. At least a billion PC user in the world, I’m not gonna claim what’s best for them</li>
  <li><strong>Developers can host their own apps</strong>: If you’re a developer and want to host your own app, that’s fine. An app store is only an entry point to discover all the different app repositories offered by all developers.</li>
  <li><strong>Recommendations not Control</strong>: I believe that it’s important to guide average users to what’s best for them. “You shouldn’t use this applications because it’s buggy”. But not do that by anointing yourself King of the world. When a user purchase an app from a developer, it’s an agreement between the two and the platform vendor has nothing to do with it. I know that this app is buggy but I still would like to use it, it’s performing a function that I really need right now, I don’t want for the developer to comply with your review process. As a platform vendor who cares about how your platform is performing and used, you can use recommendations. “Microsoft doesn’t recommend this app because of performance issues” or “because of privacy issues”, “Please read for more details”. Developers would get an explanation for the recommendation and be able to fix the problem. Microsoft gets to place its recommendation high in the list next to the application description. This recommendation would really affect user’s decision and wouldn’t be restrictive to users who know what they’re doing.</li>
  <li><strong>Standards, Standards, Standards</strong>: For this app store to be really open, and for it offer place for innovation by other software vendors, it has to rely of standards. A standard to how to discover apps, how to install them, license them, and update them. Standards that describe how these different process interact with each other, how two processes implemented by two different vendors can still work together. Microsoft can start by offering this standard and other would join.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s a shame really that Microsoft is taking over the software market like this. In times where there are attempts by governments to control the Internet, in more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOPA">ways</a> than <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/internetprivacy/2011-02-15-kill-switch_N.htm">one</a>. It doesn’t help that giant software companies are restricting computers as well.</p>
