        Don't Hate My Code

    <span class="post-date">29 Sep 2010</span>

    <p>One very common problem that occurs when a new team takes over an existing project is their desire to “just move some stuff around”. That’s a code word for “I can’t believe that you’re calling this crap a software application” :D. This, of course, varies from one project to the other. Sometimes it’s justified and is for good reasons and other times it’s not. The reason is not the desire of the new team to make a quick impact (although sometimes that’s the case “You know, we had to fix a lot of stuff behind the scene”). But most of the time the reason is derived from the simple fact that reading code is much harder than writing it.<br />
A programming language, like any other language, just because you know all the letters and all the words doesn’t mean you can parse the intended meaning. A code block, in its own way, is written to convey a certain intent to computers as their primary audience but also to other developers as a secondary audience. Some programming languages don’t care about developers and just target computers, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembly Language</a>. <br />
The problem with new teams is that they never think that one day they, too, would be the “old team”. The way to really solve this problem (having to rewrite/re-organize/restructure the codebase) is to write code in a clear enough way that anyone can understand it. Then, one day this will be common enough that you’ll understand what you are getting as anyone would understand what you are giving (Day dreaming?) (actually, on second thought, I’ll remove the question mark).<br />
The point is: _Don’t just write “good code”, write “readable good code”.<br />
However, modifying your code to be more readable is burdening your code with a responsibility that it shouldn’t have. When you read the part above about conveying intent, you’ll notice that the whole point of making the code readable is to give the reader an insight into my thought process. How did I arrive to the decision of structuring the code like that?<br />
Code is not easy to read because it’s not in sequence, you don’t know where to start and where to end and you can’t read one part of it and figure out the rest.<br />
My code has to come with that insight into my thought process. Here’s what I would do (and what I do do) to make this happen:</p>

<h5 id="write-in-bullet-points">Write in Bullet Points</h5>
<p>Programmers don’t want to read a long story. They want simple concise quick-to-read scannable sorted items that are not affected by how bad my morning coffee was.</p>

<p>I’m not specifying what type of document. This goes for all documents.</p>

<h5 id="use-xml-documentation">Use XML Documentation</h5>

<p>You know, the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b2s063f7%28v=VS.100%29.aspx">little green XML tags</a> before each member. .NET developers would know those. My summary for the “DoSomething” method used to be “Does something”. I stopped doing that when I read this description on somebody else’s code. Now, I take a moment and describe what is the “Something”, what do I mean by “Do”, what kind of output does the method deliver and what impact it has on the system, what assumptions it requires. Take a moment to think. Always take a moment.</p>

<h5 id="write-comments-first">Write Comments First</h5>

<p>Comments for code that has been already written tend to describe what the code does. “Loop through list until find target value” instead of “Find target value in list”. Changes to how the objective is achieved would impact the description even though the objective didn’t change. If I removed the loop and used a method to find the target value, I wouldn’t have to change “Find target value in list”.</p>

<p>Writing comments before code aims at outlining what is the objective of this method (or a code block within the method) and what are the logical steps and the possible scenarios that the method handles. Think of it this way, you’re a senior developer who doesn’t write code anymore but helps junior developers write the code. Use the comments to outline how the juniors will reach their goal, think in big picture (big as in the objective of the method and class). Don’t care about how you’re reading the text file, think about what do you want to do with the content of the file after it’s read. Later, you’ll go to the junior developer role and think about the optimum way to read a text file. This is done in iterations, feedback from the junior could affect the outline set by the senior who made assumptions about how this would work. Some changes have to be made to the outline to accommodate that.</p>

<p>Eventually, the comments would describe the steps that the method goes through to reach its goal. Reading code would add more details about the specific technical implementation while reading the comments would only give you a summary.</p>

<h5 id="its-not-personal-its-technical">It’s Not Personal, It’s Technical</h5>

<p>Don’t include details about people, events, dates, timeline, or progress in the project documents. Keep those items separate in their own documents. These “Team Documents” are for temporary consumption mainly by management, sometimes they’re useful for historical record but they don’t matter for new teams who just wants to read the code.</p>

<h5 id="use-meaningful-names-with-standard-naming-convention">Use Meaningful Names with Standard Naming Convention</h5>

<p>Use “i” for counter and “x” for quick math operations. Beyond that, use meaningful names that helps the reader keep track of the code flow.</p>

<p>Use standard naming convention to name and write the names of different members. I use the naming conventions of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Framework-Design-Guidelines-Conventions-Libraries/dp/0321545613">Framework Design Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>As a standard rule, pet names doesn’t count as meaningful names, unless you pet is named “UserAccountID”.</p>

<h5 id="make-it-part-of-the-process-use-documents-to-make-decisions">Make It Part of the Process. Use Documents to Make Decisions</h5>

<p>Some developers look at documentation as “I’ll get to it if/when I have time”. Not only that they never have time, but also they’re missing the point of why they should use documents in the first place. I use documents to collaborate with team members on making decisions about the different possible solutions of a specific problem. I use documents to define, scope, list possible solutions and their upsides and downsides and eventually choose the solution.</p>

<p>Communicating technical details through documents is much easier than through discussions which tends to easily stray away from the main topic, include a lot of not-fully-thought ideas, and require real time interaction (meetings which are difficult for remote teams and time consuming for… what’s the word for non-remote teams).</p>

<h5 id="keep-documents-updated">Keep Documents Updated</h5>

<p>If you’re like me, and you use documents as an intro to writing code. It’s important to keep documents updated with the changes you made later to the code you wrote earlier.</p>

<h5 id="use-a-tool">Use a Tool</h5>

<p>Using a tool like a <a href="http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx">SharePoint</a> document library or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">Wiki</a> (I like <a href="http://www.screwturn.eu/">Screwturn</a>) would encourage developers to participate in this addition to their daily tasks. It wouldn’t be just a collection of documents stored in some folder. It would be an essential part of the daily work.</p>

<h5 id="keep-versions-dont-throw-anything-away">Keep Versions. Don’t Throw Anything Away</h5>

<p>Using a tool helps you keep versions of the documents. This lets you review the progress of each document and makes you able to go back to earlier solutions that you dismissed earlier but could be viable now.</p>

<h5 id="know-when-to-stop">Know When to Stop</h5>

<p>Keep documents updated, make it part of the process, keep versions, write comments, bla bla bla. Remember that you’re getting paid to write code and create software. Using documents to build software can be really helpful but it’s not building software. Put a ceiling on how many documents and how much details you’re producing and make it supplemental to writing code. If it’s not going to lead to better code, don’t do it. Eventually you’ll find the balance the fits your process.</p>

        VM-based Development Environment
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2010</span>

    <p><img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/VMBasedDevelopmentEnvironment/VirtualBox.png" />
<img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/VMBasedDevelopmentEnvironment/VMware.png" />
I love VMs. To have a sandbox inside which there’s an operating system of your choice where you can try anything and not fear its effect on your host machine, that is empowering.</p>

<p>I started using VMs a long time ago, but recently I moved to what I call a “VM-based Development Environment”. As a GIS developer, I have a problem which is that <a href="http://www.esri.com/products/index.html#desktop_gis_panel">ArcGIS</a> (the main GIS application/platform I’m using) doesn’t allow for side-by-side installation. So, if you want to install version 9.3.1, you have to uninstall version 9.3. And those are two different versions against which you have to develop and test your code.</p>

<p>Over the years, I had a simple solution. Pick a version that I mostly work with and install on my development machine. If I’m moving to a new project that needs a different version, I would uninstall the version I’m using and install the new one. This is, aside from being painful and inefficient, an outdated solution and it created another problem that I found out about at the end of one project I was working on.</p>

<p>Because my personal machine was updated and I install all these kinds of applications with their requirements, there was a software requirement I didn’t add to the installation package and that caused a problem on one client’s machine.</p>

<p>When I started using VMs, I moved the secondary versions of ArcGIS (the ones other than the version I’m mainly using) to VMs. Also, VMs helped with testing, especially when testing installation packages using snapshots (I’ll talk about that later). However, when I faced the missing requirement problem, I decided to take VMs a step further.</p>

<p>I’m using my machine for my personal software (Browser, Outlook, Office, Video, Music, Social Media, etc), and removed all development-related software (including ArcGIS) to a Virtual Machine. So when I work on code, I turn on a VM and start coding on a machine that has the least number of software installed.</p>

<h3 id="ups">Ups</h3>

<p>Moving all development work to a VM offer number of advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To quote a development concept “Separation of Concerns”. you can have a different VM for each project if you want, if the development software is different for each project, the operating system your team is using is different, or even you just want a different mode for each project.  </li>
  <li>Clean-slate machine can help you easily identify the requirements of your code and detect the software it might conflict with.</li>
  <li>Working on Client-Server project where you want to deploy to a server and develop or test in a environment similar to the production environment.</li>
  <li>Create a VM and pass to other team members and you’ve got yourself a unified development environment for all team members.</li>
  <li>You can expand on the concept and create other VMs that can help with tasks related to development like a source code server, continuous integration server, etc.</li>
  <li>If you want to upgrade or re-install Windows on your host machine or even moved across the country to a whole new machine, copy few files and you still have your development environment intact.</li>
  <li>Distracted by all the e-mails, IMs, and tweets, just click “Full Screen” and you can easily shut all the annoyance on your host machine.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>

<p>Building a VM is not that difficult but if you’re going to create number of VMs, few if not tens, maybe I can help with some tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Categorize Your Machines</strong>: I have 4 classes of VMs:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Base</strong>: a building block I use to install all other VMs. It’s an installed and updated OS with the very basic applications (Browser, Anti-virus, etc) that makes it very easy to install a new VM within minutes. You can also have a base for specific environments like Visual Studio 2008 or 2010.</li>
      <li><strong>Dev</strong>: a machine for development. I Turn it on and start banging on the keyboard like a monkey :)</li>
      <li><strong>Lab</strong>: I use those for testing. It’s important to have different operating system with all variations (x86 and x64 for example).</li>
      <li><strong>Sandbox</strong>: want to try something that you’re not sure is completely safe? want to try a trial product that you could remove later but could leave all these bits of crap behind? Use a sandbox.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Come Up with a Naming Convention</strong>: I usually name a VM with a meaningful name that easily explain its configurations, like this</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>VMClass-OS-InstructionSet-VisualStudioVersion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>for example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dev-7-x64-10</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is a development machine with Windows 7 x64 and Visual Studio 2010</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use Memorable Names</strong>: in addition to the naming convention, I give memorable names to the machines I use most frequently. It also helps if those names represent the different classes. For example, I give cities names to Dev machines (Cairo, Phoenix, Jakarta, etc), and I give names of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table">periodic table</a> elements to Lab machines (Neon, Cobalt, Titanium, etc).</li>
  <li><strong>Understand Your Virtualization Software</strong>: whether you’re using <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware Desktop</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/">Microsoft Virtual PC</a>, or <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>. Make sure to fully understand the capabilities of the software, otherwise you could be missing out on some features that could help you.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Snapshots</strong>: one feature that VMs offer that host machines doesn’t very well is ‘Snapshots’. Snapshots helps you save the state of a machine and easily return to it with a click of a button. It’s like Windows’ Restore Point or Mac’s Time Machine but much much faster. You can also have a tree of snapshots.</li>
  <li><strong>Create a CodeBox</strong>: To share code between different machines, either create a separate virtual hard drive and store all your data on it or create a shared folder on your host machine and map it as a network drive. I use the first choice because it’s easier to backup (just copy a few files), and avoid a potential security problem of having a shared folder. Be aware of the fine differences of creating a virtual hard drive between different virtualization software and make sure that virtual hard drive persistence doesn’t depend on VM persistence.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="downs">Downs</h3>

<p>Using VMs as your main development environment isn’t hassle-free and it does have its own disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Memory Monster</strong>: VMs require that you allocate full memory capacity to them once they’re on. So, you better throw away that 3-years old 2GB laptop. If you want to use VMs, you must have at least 4GB RAM. You’re gonna be using a VM for development which means longer hours where you can’t tolerate using a 1GB RAM machine. Do you? :). With 4GB you can have 2GB for your host and 2GB for the VM but you’ll miss out on the benefits of running another VM. Upgrade to 8GB to get full power.</li>
  <li><strong>Code Not at Your Fingertips</strong>: If no Visual Studio installed on your host machine, you have to turn on (or de-hibernate) a VM to get to your code. That takes about just a minute but it’s still something.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintenance, Maintenance, Maintenance</strong>: all these VMs require taking care of. Updating Windows, anti-virus, and applications is a headache because it’s not fully automated. Mainly I focus on the few machines I’m using, but once a month, I start all Base machines to keep them updated.</li>
</ul>

    </a>
    <figcaption><small>Two Update Windows, one for a VM and the other for my host machine.</small></figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Gigabytes to Spare</strong>: you should have a lot of those because a plain simple Windows 7 machine with no software uses about 12GB of hard drive space.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve used VMs for development for quite a while now, and I feel that it improved how I work. Give it a try a let me know if it helped.</p>

        Configuring log4net and Using the AppLogger Class - Part 2
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Jul 2010</span>

    <p><em>Read the <a href="/ConfiguringLog4netPart1/">Part 1</a> for an intro to this post.</em></p>

<p>The AppLogger class is a class I use to encapsulate log4net and make easy to use. By “ease of use” I mean less lines for me to write to start logging. But, this ease of use comes on the expense of customizability. The AppLogger class is not built to fit your (or all) needs necessarily but with little work it can.</p>

<p>AppLogger contains my preferred configurations for both debug and release builds, and it embeds the XML configurations into the output assembly, while reducing the number of lines I need to write to initiate logging.</p>

<p>I’ve uploaded a copy of the project (VS2008 project) containing the class to my SkyDrive. You can find it <a href="http://cid-a0f4e46186f7cce4.office.live.com/self.aspx/Public/Blog/AppLogger/AppLoggerClass.7z">here</a> (To decompress the project files, use <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7zip</a>).</p>

<p>Normally, you would add AppLogger and the XML configuration files to your project and include it under the namespace you’re using. This way you would avoid adding another assembly to your project. For the purpose of distributing the code, I created a separate project and a separate namespace. Also, the project is using .NET framework 2.0, but it should work fine on any later version.</p>

<p>Let’s check out the project files</p>

<p><img class="imageInCenter" src="/public/images/ConfiguringLog4netPart2/AppLogger-ProjectFiles.png" /></p>

<p>The <strong>LoggerInitializationException</strong> is a fancy way of throwing an exception, it doesn’t really hold any more information than a regular exception but you can modify it to do just that.</p>

<p>The files <strong>Log4netDebugConfigurations</strong> &amp; <strong>Log4netReleaseConfigurations</strong> in the <strong>Resources</strong> folder are used to configure log4net in the Debug and Release build configurations. In this example, they have the same configurations.</p>

<p>The configurations use a <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/sdk/log4net.Appender.RollingFileAppender.html">Rolling File Appender</a> which writes to file until the file reaches a certain size (1MB in this case), then it renames the file by adding a number and write to a new file with the name you chose.</p>

<p>The pattern used in the configurations for each line in the log is</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/f4e684971160e4ea8855.js"></script>

<p>It adds the <strong>date/time stamp</strong>, <strong>thread</strong>, <strong>level</strong> (Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Fatal), name of the <strong>logger</strong>, and <strong>message</strong>.</p>

<p>You can notice in the configuration file that the file name is not specified.  </p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/4086774fa1f098a48f8b.js"></script>

<p>This is intentioned as we’ll replace it at runtime.<br />
AppLogger is written so that you can log using just one line of code without any preparations, like this:  </p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/e1968212ba7d9fadcca0.js"></script>

<p>The <strong>Logger</strong> property is a static property that holds an <strong>AppLogger</strong> object and it doesn’t need to be set. If you are calling the property for the first time, it will create a new <strong>AppLogger</strong> object and return it to the calling method.  </p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/a7dffcaa5ff49218bf91.js"></script>

<p>The <strong>AppLogger</strong> constructor takes care of configuring log4net using the embedded XML files based on the build configurations.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/0bdc92291fd92f9ed336.js"></script>

<p>You can see that the constructor creates a file in the Temp folder (for ups and downs of this choice, read <a href="/ConfiguringLog4netPart1/">Part 1</a>), and modifies the XML file before configuring log4net with a stream of the file. Then it sets the <strong>LogFilePath</strong> property with a path to the log file.</p>

<p>It also uses preprocessor directives (<strong>#if DEBUG</strong>) to configure log4net differently in the debug and release configurations. You can make the code less in size by using the same configurations. This constructor happens to use the same configuration but I wanted to show that you can use different configurations.
By default, AppLogger will suppress its errors. So even if initialization failed or any other error occurs, logging will stop but you don’t have to modify your code to catch any exceptions.</p>

<p>If you want to catch logging exceptions, you can change the <strong>SuppressError</strong> property by writing:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/82a2b5f03f54b2555b78.js"></script>

<p>AppLogger makes it easy and fast to start logging but it has its downsides as well. Calling the <strong>AppLogger.Logger</strong> static property has a performance overhead more than other properties since it checks if the logger hasn’t been created yet. If your application has one entry point (Console application, Windows application, etc.) you can move the initialization code to the entry point and get rid of the overhead.</p>

<p>Also, the configuration I’m using creates a log file with a name that is not predefined which makes it difficult to find sometimes unless you use the <strong>LogFilePath</strong> property. You can change the configurations to fit your workflow, as this fits mine.
I’ve used the AppLogger class for number of projects and it’s working fine, I hope it helps you as well.</p>

        Configuring log4net and Using the AppLogger Class - Part 1
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Jul 2010</span>

    <p>It’s been quite a while since I started using log4net for logging, and it changed how I debug applications. I found it much easier to find the source of an error by reading the log after the application crashes rather than using the step-by-step debugging in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>I started using log4net after reading an excellent tutorial by Jim Christopher on his blog <a href="http://www.beefycode.com/">BeefyCode</a>. You can find a list of all the posts in the tutorial <a href="http://www.beefycode.com/post/Log4Net-Tutorials-and-Resources.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some people prefer to log the application activities for debugging purposes only which works well in desktop applications that doesn’t have a mechanism for sending the log back to the developer in case of unexpected behavior. This has its obvious upside, which is improving the application performance by avoiding logging. To limit logging to debugging purposes only, simply surround all logging code with the conditional preprocessor directive #if.</p>

<p>For the using statements:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/a47245174b9b0e4e297d.js"></script>

<p>And for the logging code:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/dabf83db0a6450605e12.js"></script>

<p>There are different choices for a destination of your application’s log, Database, Console, File, System event log, Memory, E-mail, Telnet, and even <a href="http://caseywatson.com/2009/07/07/log4net-twitter-awesome/">Twitter</a> which I don’t think is very practical (no one would follow a feed that delivers only bad news).</p>

<p>Those different destinations offer different advantages and are fit for different scenarios. You can use the preprocessor directive to apply different configurations for debugging and release.</p>

<p>One obvious scenario is to use a database for debugging and a file for release. In a large development environment where different individuals work on development and testing, logging to a database offers some advantages like keeping a record of how the application behaves and easily sharing that record among different team members. With simple tools and shared procedure, this log can be linked to the issue tracking system within the organization.</p>

<p>I use a text file as a destination. It’s easy to set up and use and not so difficult to read. I also use a XML file for configurations rather than programmatically (which only few prefer). I found that the best of both worlds is to embed the configurations file in the application resources and then stream it at runtime to configure the logger using the stream.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/32551c94813e78d24298.js"></script>

<p>This helps solving one of the problems I ran into, which is configuring log4net for the release version. In the debug mode, you can easily hard code the path to the destination file and you have administrator privileges to write to any folder you like. In the release mode, you can’t really control – or predict – the environment where the logger will work. You have to plan for something safe that you know will work in any environment.</p>

<p>Writing log to the application installation folder does not work under Windows 7 (or Vista). Unless the application is running as an administrator, logging will fail. Try to use the Application Data folder or the Temp folder.</p>

<p>In the Application Data folder, you have to manage the growing number of files as the application continues to log to them but you have the advantage of being able to keep the log files (unless the user goes to the folder and delete the files, nothing will happen to them).</p>

<p>In the Temp folder, you have to avoid creating a file with a name that already exist, and your log file will probably be deleted by the next time you run the application.</p>

<p>I create a log file in the Temp folder because I don’t really need the log file beyond the current session, and to avoid creating a file with a duplicate name simply use:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/c742277b8302fff05b67.js"></script>

<p>Now, I want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Configure log4net using XML file.</li>
  <li>Determine the path to the log file at runtime.</li>
  <li>Avoid shipping a configuration file with the assembly (include the configuration file inside the assembly).</li>
  <li>Reduce the number of lines I have to write to initiate logging.</li>
</ul>

<p>To do all that, and reuse the solution across all the projects I work on, I use the AppLogger class. How use it and how it works is a topic of <a href="/ConfiguringLog4netPart2/">another post</a>.  </p>

        Filtering Search Results by Site
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Jul 2010</span>

    <p>I like <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a> and I’ve been using it since its launch last year. One of the ways that can improve my experience with Bing is to make it easier to filter search results by a certain URL. I do this filtering a lot so I’m used to using the keyword “site:” in the search box, what is difficult about it is entering the URL. So, I’m suggesting a new addition to the UI that can be optional where users will opt-in to use it.</p>

<p>Simply add a small dropdown list next to the search box from which the user can select the URL he wants to filter results by. The items in the list are customizable and appear as a short alias that can be easily remembered by the user.</p>

<p><img class="imageInCenter" src="/public/images/FilteringSearchResultsBySite/SearchSitesUI01.png" /></p>

<p>When the user selects an item from the list, the item’s alias is displayed next to the dropdown button with an italic font.</p>

<p><img class="imageInCenter" src="/public/images/FilteringSearchResultsBySite/SearchSitesUI02.png" /></p>

<p>When the user hovers over the alias in italic, a tooltip is displayed to show the full URL of the site with which the results are filtered.</p>

<p><img class="imageInCenter" src="/public/images/FilteringSearchResultsBySite/SearchSitesUI03.png" /></p>

<p>At the bottom of the list, the item “Customize this list…” that can help with adding, editing and removing items in the list.
 I think this is a feature that can be (relatively) easily implemented and I’m sure that it will help a lot of users out there. I hope it can find its way to implementation soon.</p>
