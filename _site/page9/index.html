        Getting on the Geo Train
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2008</span>

    <p>So, looks like Acrobat 9 is getting map support. But instead of talking about what is it exactly what Acrobat 9 is supporting (which you find <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatproextended/">here</a>), I’m gonna focus on with the question "why". Acrobat has no relation with GIS or GeoWeb, but it seems like Geo info is the next big thing (or at least one of them) where everyone wants to get a part of it (of course, not as big as advertisement). Google Earth (currently <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/earth/">accessible</a> at any browser near you), Live maps (with the amazing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Search_Maps#Bird.27s_eye_view">bird’s eye</a> functionality), and yahoo maps are on the geo train for a while now as GIS (or to be more specific geo-info) is being brought to the masses by car navigation devices, and cell phone embedded GPSs.</p>

<p>But even "Why" is not the key question here, "Who" is. Geo-enabled apps are being brought to the masses by companies that had close to no existence in the GIS market, 3 or 4 years ago. <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a>, <a href="http://www.erdas.com">ERDAS</a>, <a href="http://www.intergraph.com">Intergraph</a> and other GIS software vendors who has been in this business for years if not decades, are not the ones who is bringing GIS to the masses. On the contrary, these companies still have no significant - or even absolutely no - contribution to GeoWeb.</p>

<p>So, instead of simplifying GIS in a way that would make the average Joe be able to explode its full potential. The regular databases and information systems are being extended to store X and Y coordinates to represent locations on a map. This extending is a big step, but it only limits the functionalities to answering the questions of how far, how large, and which is closer.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s up to the GIS software vendors not to bring GIS to the masses. It could be their idea to keep low profile and enjoy their share of the GIS market without a competition with the big guys (GIS market was <a href="http://www.gisdevelopment.net/magazine/years/2004/dec/setting1.htm">estimated in 2004 to be  2.2B$, where software represent 64%</a>). A friend of mine who works for a GIS software vendor told about how they’re avoiding their software in comparison with Google Earth to avoid explaining why their software is that expensive. This kind of behavior is what is keeping the GIS genie in the bottle, and it will go on until the attitude changes (I don’t see why) or another software vendor gets in the market and maybe change the rules a bit.</p>

<p>Until then, we’re just watching more people getting on the geo train. </p>

        It's Getting Really Old
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2008</span>

    <p>Yesterday, I watched the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Iewhh9a1tA">new</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_a_Mac">“Get A Mac”</a> ad. And unlike other <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=3097C6C21AADCE7E">ads</a> before, no new Mac features were introduced and the joke wasn’t even that funny. There is no doubt about the fact that Mac OS market share is feeding on Windows users, it’s not like new users are growing on trees here. But, there’s no need to be that destructive. The Get A Mac ad campaign started out by making a point which was that Mac is better than PC and Mac OS X is better than any other OS (a.k.a. windows) because it has lots of stuff. And every ad used to tell the story of a certain feature. Like the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToOSg5cEX7c">one</a> that has many Macs that are taking about Time Machine feature, which is if you’re a regular windows user wouldn’t know that windows had something similar since XP which is “Restore Point” but it had never been an easy to use or popular feature that is worth making an ad for.</p>

<p>Then the ads became just funny, like the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMGfLa3s48w">one</a> with the group therapy where there’s no point other than making fun of Vista and branding Mac as the cool kid in the block more than it already is. But when you start over profiting from anything, it backfires.</p>

<p>Some people are asking “How do they get away with it” as in how can a company say something that mean about another company and not get sued. I don’t know, I’m not a lawyer, but I think that they - Apple - don’t wanna get away with it, they don’t care. Apple always been a fan of making fun of competitors. There was the famous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R706isyDrqI">“1984”</a> ad that pictured IBM as the dominate dictator who is brain-washing everyone. And I remember those banners in Mac World conference couple of years ago that said “Redmond, Start your Photocopiers” (as in Microsoft is copying everything Apple is doing). And of course, tons of Steve Jobs’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhy7ehkgWcg">remarks on competitors</a> in Mac World demos. It’s a natural extension of Apple’s arrogant attitude drawn from their CEO’s ego. </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I admire Steve Jobs, the guy built Apple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs#Return_to_Apple">twice</a>, and if you wanna know the man himself, just watch his Stanford commencement address <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc">speech</a> in 2005 (really wise stuff) but there’s no doubt that Steve’s ego is really burning Apple’s bridges with other companies. Once in 1997, Apple needed help from Microsoft for its resurrection. Of course, Microsoft got a fair deal (settlements for for Patent disputes, IE as the default browser on Mac, and revenues from Office for Mac and Apple shares) but if Microsoft knew that Apple would be mocking Vista like they are now, I’m sure Microsoft would have been thinking this through.</p>

        Personalized TV Guide
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 May 2008</span>

    <p>I was watching TV this morning and I went through my 37-channels favorite list and I found nothing interesting to watch. So, I turned to the TV guide. I don’t use the guide that much so here’s my impression. SHOCKED. the TV guide is listing more than 800 channels, how am I supposed to go through these. Of course there’s a categorization for shows by theme, channel, or title.  Maybe other cable boxes even have search. But, that’s not what I want to do, I just want to watch a good show, I don’t know what it is but I want it and I want it now. I got frustrated with the TV guide so I turned off the TV and turned to the computer to check my Gmail, I opened a new e-mail and I found this small ad in the top banner about something related to the e-mail I’m reading right at the same moment. So, I thought what if my TV (or rather cable box) can do that.</p>

<p>Here’s the idea, What if TV channels have enough metadata to suggest shows to the viewer. Metadata can include Show Rating, Theme, Production Year, Cast Names. The viewer selects his/her favorite picks in each of these categories and there’s magic. It’s simple matter of mix and match.</p>

<p>Now, here’s the problem, I don’t know how cable boxes work, I don’t have a cable company to apply something like this. So, I thought I just put this out there for anyone to apply it. But I reserve the right of having one of those cable boxes for free.</p>

<p>By the way, if by any chance, someone already applied this idea, let me know.</p>

        GIS, GPS, LBS, and GeoWeb: They're different, People
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 May 2008</span>

    <p>When I tell anyone one that I work in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">GIS</a> and tell them about what it’s about, I always get the response of "Oh, I know what that is, it’s the little screen in my car with the navigator". No people, that’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a>. Smarter responses include "Is that part of GPS?" and "Yeah, I know what that is, I use Google Maps". But All of that is still not GIS. So, I’m gonna write this down for one last time and the next person to ask me about what I’m doing for living, I’ll just give him the link for this post.</p>

<p><strong>GPS</strong></p>

<p>Let’s start with the most known one, GPS. The Global Positioning System is a network of satellites that orbits around the earth at let a receiver device determine its location, speed, direction, and time. The receiver device (which is commonly known as "GPS") needs to be connected to at least 4 satellites to determine its location, and hence speed, direction and time. GPS is an American system, and it’s the only completely implemented global navigation satellite system. There are other GNSS like Russian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS">GLONASS</a>, European <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_positioning_system">Galileo</a>, the proposed Chinese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMPASS_navigation_system">COMPASS</a>, and Indian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Regional_Navigational_Satellite_System">IRNSS</a>. GPS devices are now widely, not just used but also, integrated into other devices like cars, smart phones, and cameras.</p>

<p><strong>GIS</strong></p>

<p>Geographic Information System is the implementation of database for spatial data. If a database can have text, numbers, dates, and photos, it can have maps as well. It’s not just about the location, it’s about querying the location and analyzing that location with respect to other locations. It’s just like querying and analyzing tabular data. The only difference is that if a picture is worth a thousand words, a map is worth a thousand pictures. </p>

<p>GIS is a mix of science (Geography), information systems, and modern software technologies that hasn’t - unfortunately - exploit the potentials of GIS yet, but hopefully one day it will.</p>

<p><strong>GeoWeb</strong></p>

<p>This is the new buzz, and I think we owe the credit to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole,_Inc.">Keyhole</a>. Keyhole was the company that created the software that we know now as Google Earth. In 2004, Google acquired Keyhole and changed their paid software to a free software that we all use now.</p>

<p>It was Google Earth and its user generated content that required the creation of this new term "GeoWeb". GeoWeb is basically to provide a geographic dimension to the information on the web. You want to find a house in your area, but what really defines "Your Area", it’s where you think is close to you and you can’t define that unless you use a map.</p>

<p>Even though GeoWeb is the natural evolution of GIS - It’s GIS for the public, where everyone can search, add, or analyze spatial-based information -, the GeoWeb didn’t come from a GIS software company but rather a company founded only in 2001.</p>

<p><strong>LBS</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location-based_service">Location Based Services</a> is the product of GIS, GPS, GeoWeb, and mobile computing. Here’s a scenario of what LBS can offer, you’re on the go and you want to find the nearest favorite sports store, you pick up your cell phone and connect to the Internet to get that info, easy, then you get directions to the store and as you move, the cell phone adjusts the route and suggests other routs depending on the traffic and how long is the route, still easy. As you approach the store you get a message telling you that there’s another sports store near by that is offering 50% discount on exactly what you’re looking for. Now, that’s not easy. Of course there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location-based_service#LBS_applications">other applications</a> to LBS, but this is one of its most widely known ones. It’s about offering the right information at the right time in the right location so you can act on it immediately, and if that info is an ad, that mean there gonna be <a href="http://www.google.com">people</a> looking forward for LBS.</p>

<p>Google has been working building an <a href="http://gigaom.com/2006/08/15/google-launches-wifi-network-in-mountain-view/">alternative</a> to LBS that can be implemented now. Based on a free widely available WiFi network, Google can distribute ads to those logging in to the network with their Google account.</p>

<p>Downside, Privacy. LBS - in my opinion as one whose working in GIS - is a major violation of privacy. It’s not just that the service providers know who you are and what you’re interested in, but also where you are and where you’ve been. Your location is identified in real time but also could be logged very easily. And who knows who’s listening.</p>

<p><strong>Anyway</strong>, forget about the differences between the technical terms. One thing is for sure, Location is next big buzz.</p>
