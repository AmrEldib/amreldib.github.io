        Why Help Suck (1 of 2)
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Jul 2008</span>

    <p>Ever used the help system? Of course you have. Hated it? Of course you did. No body likes to go into the Help menu and just browse the Help Content. Everybody seems to try to use those other resources (forums, blogs, screen casts, etc.) to learn how to go around the software they’re using. Since this is quite clear, why would you bother build a Help Contents for your software. Most software vendors already know that, yet the only obvious enhancement in Help systems is to make it online. In other words, make it everywhere.</p>

<p>But what’s wrong with Help. I mean we know it’s not the best thing, but what’s exactly is wrong with it.</p>

<p>First, It’s a lot of reading. No body likes to read that much, even book lovers, they read for fun and knowledge not for solving problems. It’s like those emergency instructions, the plane is going down, your hair is on fire and you’re reading the emergency instructions. Users don’t want to read those long pages just to figure out an solution to their problem, they want “Help”. They want answers to their questions, which are most likely not to be included in the frequently asked questions (I don’t know where do these come from anyway).</p>

<p>Second, when users turn to help, they’re looking for answers. That means Search, right? well, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Compiled_HTML_Help">CHM</a> (the most used format for help files) have a terrible search capabilities and results. The problem with using plain search for help is it’s not optimized for finding answers for questions. A user should be able to enter a question and get an answer for it. Online help system have better search capabilities but they still lead to the same boring content.</p>

<p>Finally, It’s not that help content is long and unreadable. It’s that “everybody” has to read (or rather scan) it to get any information out of it. A beginner user doesn’t need to know every little detail that a power user might be looking for. Users don’t just want answers to their questions, they also want that answer in a way they understand.</p>

<p>But it’s not like help systems are that bad all the way and no one tried to make them better. Some companies are actually trying. The new Vista help looks pretty good.</p>

<p> <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3246/2691552724_ae0b9a5942.jpg?v=0" title="Snapshot of Vista Help System"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/eldib.amr/SIVWTxsb2zI/AAAAAAAAABY/fzBxN4p1zDk/clip_image001%5B17%5D.png?imgmax=800" alt="clip_image001" title="clip_image001" /></a></p>

<p>You can see from the snapshot that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Search is front and center in the help window, it’s your primarily entry point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Windows Basics is the first item in the “Find an answer” section. Because it’s a help system for Windows which is the most basic thing, the users expected to land here are beginners (and I mean people who need a second to tell the difference between a mouse and a keyboard).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Windows Online Help is important because offline help can’t be updated as online help. It should be reached easily.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most software application put “What’s New” up front, which is not a topic for help but rather a topic for white papers. Good job to keep the section but put it at the end of the list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, because the expected users are beginners, it’s logical to offer them a chance to contact someone for help.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The offline help sign switch the search box results to include results from online help.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Other help systems include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Option to comment on the content page where users can add their own experience and discuss the content of the page.*   Social tools to share the content of those pages.*   Discussion forums.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of that seems fine but still not enough. What would it take for a help system not to suck. Let’s leave that to another post.</p>

        Getting on the Geo Train
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2008</span>

    <p>So, looks like Acrobat 9 is getting map support. But instead of talking about what is it exactly what Acrobat 9 is supporting (which you find <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatproextended/">here</a>), I’m gonna focus on with the question "why". Acrobat has no relation with GIS or GeoWeb, but it seems like Geo info is the next big thing (or at least one of them) where everyone wants to get a part of it (of course, not as big as advertisement). Google Earth (currently <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/earth/">accessible</a> at any browser near you), Live maps (with the amazing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Search_Maps#Bird.27s_eye_view">bird’s eye</a> functionality), and yahoo maps are on the geo train for a while now as GIS (or to be more specific geo-info) is being brought to the masses by car navigation devices, and cell phone embedded GPSs.</p>

<p>But even "Why" is not the key question here, "Who" is. Geo-enabled apps are being brought to the masses by companies that had close to no existence in the GIS market, 3 or 4 years ago. <a href="http://www.esri.com">ESRI</a>, <a href="http://www.erdas.com">ERDAS</a>, <a href="http://www.intergraph.com">Intergraph</a> and other GIS software vendors who has been in this business for years if not decades, are not the ones who is bringing GIS to the masses. On the contrary, these companies still have no significant - or even absolutely no - contribution to GeoWeb.</p>

<p>So, instead of simplifying GIS in a way that would make the average Joe be able to explode its full potential. The regular databases and information systems are being extended to store X and Y coordinates to represent locations on a map. This extending is a big step, but it only limits the functionalities to answering the questions of how far, how large, and which is closer.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s up to the GIS software vendors not to bring GIS to the masses. It could be their idea to keep low profile and enjoy their share of the GIS market without a competition with the big guys (GIS market was <a href="http://www.gisdevelopment.net/magazine/years/2004/dec/setting1.htm">estimated in 2004 to be  2.2B$, where software represent 64%</a>). A friend of mine who works for a GIS software vendor told about how they’re avoiding their software in comparison with Google Earth to avoid explaining why their software is that expensive. This kind of behavior is what is keeping the GIS genie in the bottle, and it will go on until the attitude changes (I don’t see why) or another software vendor gets in the market and maybe change the rules a bit.</p>

<p>Until then, we’re just watching more people getting on the geo train. </p>

    <p>Yesterday, I watched the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Iewhh9a1tA">new</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_a_Mac">“Get A Mac”</a> ad. And unlike other <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=3097C6C21AADCE7E">ads</a> before, no new Mac features were introduced and the joke wasn’t even that funny. There is no doubt about the fact that Mac OS market share is feeding on Windows users, it’s not like new users are growing on trees here. But, there’s no need to be that destructive. The Get A Mac ad campaign started out by making a point which was that Mac is better than PC and Mac OS X is better than any other OS (a.k.a. windows) because it has lots of stuff. And every ad used to tell the story of a certain feature. Like the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToOSg5cEX7c">one</a> that has many Macs that are taking about Time Machine feature, which is if you’re a regular windows user wouldn’t know that windows had something similar since XP which is “Restore Point” but it had never been an easy to use or popular feature that is worth making an ad for.</p>

<p>Then the ads became just funny, like the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMGfLa3s48w">one</a> with the group therapy where there’s no point other than making fun of Vista and branding Mac as the cool kid in the block more than it already is. But when you start over profiting from anything, it backfires.</p>

<p>Some people are asking “How do they get away with it” as in how can a company say something that mean about another company and not get sued. I don’t know, I’m not a lawyer, but I think that they - Apple - don’t wanna get away with it, they don’t care. Apple always been a fan of making fun of competitors. There was the famous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R706isyDrqI">“1984”</a> ad that pictured IBM as the dominate dictator who is brain-washing everyone. And I remember those banners in Mac World conference couple of years ago that said “Redmond, Start your Photocopiers” (as in Microsoft is copying everything Apple is doing). And of course, tons of Steve Jobs’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhy7ehkgWcg">remarks on competitors</a> in Mac World demos. It’s a natural extension of Apple’s arrogant attitude drawn from their CEO’s ego. </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I admire Steve Jobs, the guy built Apple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs#Return_to_Apple">twice</a>, and if you wanna know the man himself, just watch his Stanford commencement address <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc">speech</a> in 2005 (really wise stuff) but there’s no doubt that Steve’s ego is really burning Apple’s bridges with other companies. Once in 1997, Apple needed help from Microsoft for its resurrection. Of course, Microsoft got a fair deal (settlements for for Patent disputes, IE as the default browser on Mac, and revenues from Office for Mac and Apple shares) but if Microsoft knew that Apple would be mocking Vista like they are now, I’m sure Microsoft would have been thinking this through.</p>

    <p>I was watching TV this morning and I went through my 37-channels favorite list and I found nothing interesting to watch. So, I turned to the TV guide. I don’t use the guide that much so here’s my impression. SHOCKED. the TV guide is listing more than 800 channels, how am I supposed to go through these. Of course there’s a categorization for shows by theme, channel, or title.  Maybe other cable boxes even have search. But, that’s not what I want to do, I just want to watch a good show, I don’t know what it is but I want it and I want it now. I got frustrated with the TV guide so I turned off the TV and turned to the computer to check my Gmail, I opened a new e-mail and I found this small ad in the top banner about something related to the e-mail I’m reading right at the same moment. So, I thought what if my TV (or rather cable box) can do that.</p>

<p>Here’s the idea, What if TV channels have enough metadata to suggest shows to the viewer. Metadata can include Show Rating, Theme, Production Year, Cast Names. The viewer selects his/her favorite picks in each of these categories and there’s magic. It’s simple matter of mix and match.</p>

<p>Now, here’s the problem, I don’t know how cable boxes work, I don’t have a cable company to apply something like this. So, I thought I just put this out there for anyone to apply it. But I reserve the right of having one of those cable boxes for free.</p>

<p>By the way, if by any chance, someone already applied this idea, let me know.</p>
