        PowerShell Study Notes
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Nov 2011</span>

    <p><img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/PowerShellStudyNotes/PowerShellLogo.jpg" /></p>

<p>Last week, I found a great PowerShell tutorial over at <a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/Courses/TableOfContents?courseName=powershell-intro">Pluralsight</a> (by <a href="http://arcanecode.com">Robert Cain</a>). PowerShell has been a topic that I wanted to learn about for quite a while. As any power user/geek type of person, the command line is my friend but the standard DOS command line has been the same for years. That’s why PowerShell seemed so compiling. But the fact that it’s based on/using .NET objects and that it’s now integrated in Visual Studio 2010 made it a priority to understand what it’s all about.</p>

<p>I finished the tutorial in a day. It’s less than 3 hours long and it’s pretty straight forward. I went over the tutorial again for a deeper understanding and took down some notes that I’m attacking to this post (You can <a href="/public/images/PowerShellStudyNotes/PowerShell Study Notes.docx">view the document online here</a>).</p>

<p>I also found <a href="http://www.powershellpro.com/powershell-tutorial-introduction/">another tutorial here</a>, that is a series of posts with more details on PowerShell. You’ll find the list of posts in the series on the right side under the title “PowerShell Tutorials”.</p>

<p>Basically PowerShell is a command line that handles .NET objects so that when a command return a result that result is a .NET object that you can retrieve the values of its properties or execute its methods. Even if the result is a simple string or integer, it’s a string object or int object.</p>

<p>PowerShell is built with three very nice concepts in mind. <strong>One</strong>, it has a script language built-in that has the basic capabilities and concepts of any programming language. Most are like .NET languages but always check your assumptions as it might lead to some confusion. <strong>Two</strong>, it uses aliases for commands, so you’ll find that most DOS and Linux commands are supported; not as native commands but rather as aliases to native commands. <strong>Three</strong>, it uses providers to support additional commands. For example, you can load the SQL provider and access SQL objects.</p>

<p>I don’t want to dive too much into the topic, but I thought I should sum it up to get you interested if you’re new to it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I hope the study notes can help. You can <a href="https://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/Subscribe/Step1?isTrial=True">try out the Pluralsight courses here</a>, they have very reasonable <a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/Products/Individual">subscription plans</a>. You can follow them and thank them on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pluralsight">their Facebook page</a> if you like their stuff.</p>

        What I Use, Part 2
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2011</span>

    <p>A few weeks I started with the hardware, today I continue with the software and services.</p>

<h3 id="operating-system">Operating System</h3>

<p><img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part2/WhatIUse2-Windows7.jpg" /></p>

<p>Windows, what else? For a .NET developer, it’s really difficult to use another OS on your primary machine. I’m not a big fan of MacOS. Apple’s strength is in hardware not software, Windows is the best OS to run on a Mac. However, I love the idea of Linux. Not just the free and open source part of it, but the customizability of it. MacOS does few things very well and doesn’t let you draw outside the lines. Windows does a lot of things in mediocre to good way but because of the huge user base it has been turned upside down and inside out so many times to let a great degree of customization. Linux does everything in a poor way if you’re a beginner and great way if you’re a pro. Linux allows for a big degree of customization that is too much to resist for a power user. I’d love to switch to Linux (probably, Ubuntu) on my primary machine. Meanwhile, this post is coming to you from Windows 7 x64.</p>

<h3 id="browsers">Browsers</h3>

<p><a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org/"><strong>Mozilla Nightly</strong></a></p>

<p><img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part2/WhatIUse2-FirefoxAuroraNightlyLogo.jpg" />
Mozilla really made it easy to follow up on the different editions of Firefox when they announced <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/">Aurora</a> and <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org/">Nightly</a>. Nightly updates everyday but gives a sneak peak into all the latest features. Nightly have another advantage over Firefox, its x64 edition. This requires using a x64 edition of Flash which is finally <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/">available from Adobe</a>. It’s also causes giving up on Silverlight (sadly doesn’t have a x64 edition).  </p>

<p><img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part2/WhatIUse2-IE9.jpg" />
<img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part2/WhatIUse2-Chrome.jpg" />
Other than Firefox, I’d like to keep other browsers installed for testing web applications on multiple browsers. Chrome is a really good browser that I would probably use if it wasn’t for Firefox and the fact that it’s built by Google. The monster is big enough and doesn’t need more reach into our personal data.</p>

<p>Internet Explorer is already installed with Windows, but with IE9 you don’t have to hate it so much. It’s fast but have very few features compared to Firefox and Chrome.</p>

<h3 id="documents">Documents</h3>

<p><img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part2/WhatIUse2-Office2010.jpg" /></p>

<p>Office with Windows is a no-brainer. Unlike most people, I really like the ribbon. Over versions 2007 and 2010, I discovered a lot of features because of the ribbon. Word and Excel are the applications that I use the most, but I really like Visio which is a great tool for visualizing ideas.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/Secure_PDF_Reader/">Foxit Reader</a></strong></p>

<p>Like most people, for a long time, I used Adobe Reader as the PDF reader. It was the only one out there, until Foxit Reader came along and put speed into PDF reading. Version 5 of Foxit kept the great features but switched its visual appearance which made it a bit difficult to use it.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html"><strong>Sumatra PDF</strong></a></p>

<p>Sumatra PDF is free, open source, fast and lightweight. Works really well, except it doesn’t have a tabbed interface which I got used to after using Foxit for a while.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pdfforge.org/"><strong>PDFCreator</strong></a></p>

<p>Easily create PDFs using a printer. I’ve noticed an error when printing an Arabic document, but it works well for the occasional PDF printing.</p>

<p><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/"><strong>Notepad++</strong></a></p>

<p>Are you still not using Notepad++, really? really?</p>

<h3 id="dev-tools">Dev Tools</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/"><strong>VirtualBox</strong></a></p>

<p>VMware is great, but VirtualBox is just as good. I’ve wrote before about <a href="http://www.amreldib.com/2010/08/vm-based-development-environment.html">how I use virtualization in development</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.getpaint.net/"><strong>Paint.NET</strong></a></p>

<p>As far as I can remember, this was the first .NET open source application I use on regular basis and actually enjoy using. Paint.NET is really powerful and cover all the image editing scenarios that I need either as a developer or a power user.</p>

<p><a href="http://icofx.ro/"><strong>IcoFx</strong></a></p>

<p>As a developer, I don’t really create any icons but sometimes, I need to modify an icon. IcoFx works really well. Version 2.0 is now only a shareware but version 1.6 is a freeware. You can <a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_icofx/6890/">download it here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="visual-studio-2010-extensions">Visual Studio 2010 Extensions</h3>

<p><img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part2/WhatIUse2-VisualStudio2010.jpg" />
I thought it would be fitting to list the VS 2010 extensions that I use. It’s really easy to figure out their use from the title.</p>

<h3 id="cloud-file-storage">Cloud File Storage</h3>

<p>With all the different offerings of file storage in the cloud, if difficult to pick just one. Almost all of them are free (at least have a free starting package that is enough for the occasional use). Here’s how I use different tools for different purpose.</p>

<p><img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part2/WhatIUse2-Dropbox.png" /></p>

<p>If you’re using a file that needs to be synced across different devices, then Dropbox is your best choice. It’s easy, fast and you’re dealing with a local file so it’s easy to forget that you’re actually syncing a file. Dropbox is great for sharing files with friends, because most people have it. Refer a friend to Dropbox or take advantage or their offers to increase space, I’ve increased mine to 4.5 GB (They have up to 10GB of free space).</p>

<p>The downside of Dropbox is privacy. Their use of duplication technology to store one copy of a file across all users means that they’re reading every file you upload.</p>

<p><a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials?os=other"><strong>Live Mesh and SkyDrive</strong></a></p>

<p><img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part2/WhatIUse2-SkyDrive.png" />
For a Windows Phone user, SkyDrive is an essential part of the service. Photos are uploaded automatically and Office documents as well. SkyDrive is great in terms of size. Can’t go wrong with 25GB of free space. Live Mesh on the other hand is more of remote access tool rather than a file sync tool. It’s only available on Windows, so it can’t sync with a lot of devices. However, SkyDrive and Live Mesh are making great advances, and I expect that I’ll be using more of them compared to Dropbox.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tonido.com/"><strong>Tonido</strong></a></p>

<p><img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part2/WhatIUse2-Tonido.png" />
If you worry about your privacy in anyway, you’ll love Tonido. It lets you set up your own server offering your files for access over the Internet. The way it works is you install a small piece of software on your home machine (for example), register a sub-domain with Tonido for free, then the folders on the home machine are now available for access from any of Tonido’s clients including Web and all major smart phones (iPhone, Android, and WP7). It’s free and super easy to use. The downside is that access to your files depend on your Internet upload speed which is usually much lower than your download speed. However, Tonido acts as fall-back solution to Dropbox and SkyDrive, whatever file is not available on either service can be accessed via Tonido. Also, it’s great for accessing files through the phone when within the house WiFi range. If it detects that you’re within the same LAN as the server, it won’t go through the Internet but rather through the LAN directly which is much faster. The upside of Tonido is you can access all of your files all the time for free from anywhere.</p>

<h3 id="social-media-and-communication">Social Media and Communication</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.metrotwit.com/"><strong>MetroTwit</strong></a></p>

<p>I was never a fan of TweetDeck, and MetroTwit came along to offer a strong replacement. I was an early adopter to support a .NET/WPF project that seemed to have potential. But later it turned into a strong contender for best Twitter client on Windows. It’s really beautiful, based on the new Metro UI that is the cornerstone of WP7. It has almost all of the features that make for a great Twitter experience. However, if you’re a heavy Twitter user like I’m, you’ll start to run into the sluggishness that MetroTwit starts to have when dealing with really big numbers of tweets. The Plugin Container that hosts the displayed media (when playing a YouTube video or viewing a photo in-place) crashes often. This doesn’t affect the application itself, but it’s one of the areas that need work for the application to come out of beta. After all, it’s still the best Twitter client I’ve used.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.trillian.im/"><strong>Trillian</strong></a></p>

<p>For a very long time, I’ve used Google Talk (which has become very very boring after not receiving any updates for the last 4 years at least) and Windows Live Messenger (good example of the unnecessarily  bloated software from Microsoft) everyday. Now Trillian comes along to replace both with slick interface, attractive features, and great degree of control and customization that please a power user like me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/home"><strong>Skype</strong></a></p>

<p>Skype is like Twitter, you hate the software but love the service and can’t really replace it.</p>

<h3 id="file-management">File Management</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.cubicreality.com/"><strong>CubicExplorer</strong></a></p>

<p>There are number of alternatives for Windows Explorer out there. Most of them are built for the super geek power user, but CubicExplorer actually works for the regular power user who wants to have bookmarks, restore session, and multi tabs. It’s free and open source, have nice themes and other web-browser-like functionality. Downside is that it’s built by one person and sometimes it can go for months without updates (which could be fine, there isn’t a lot of updates needed in the file browser world).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codesector.com/teracopy.php"><strong>TeraCopy</strong></a></p>

<p>Throw away this awful Windows copier and replace it with TeraCopy. It supports pause and resume, listing handled files, and it completely replace Windows copier.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite"><strong>Daemon Lite</strong></a></p>

<p>Until Windows 8 comes along with native support for mounting ISO files, Daemon Lite is my tool of choice. Using ISO files has become much more common than it use to be, and it has become a natural replacement for using CDs/DVDs. I haven’t used my DVD in a long time, and I have gone for few months without it when I ran out of ports. ISOs are much more convenient, and the proliferation of 8 and 16GBs USB sticks has made it more convenient. Even when installing Windows, I can use a USB stick with a <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Windows-7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool/3000-18513_4-10972600.html">simple utility</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://infrarecorder.org/"><strong>InfraRecorder</strong></a></p>

<p>This utility is built originally to burn CDs/DVDs but I use it exclusively to create ISOs. Free and works great.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a></strong></p>

<p>Calibre is not really for managing files but digital books are a form of books. For a Kindle user like me who uses Kindle for more than reading books (reading articles, and blog posts), Calibre really helps keep my library in order. It can download and edit books metadata, can manage books on the Kindle, and can grab RSS items and turn them into e-books and place them automatically on your Kindle (or any other e-book reader). Try it.</p>

<h3 id="media">Media</h3>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a></strong></p>

<p><img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part2/WhatIUse2-VLC.jpg" />
To play any video, use VLC. It’s that simple. Video are not like music where other features of the application would matter. For videos there’s only one feature that matter, Can I play it? with VLC the answer is always “Yes”.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.zune.net/en-US/products/software/download/default.htm">Zune</a></strong></p>

<p>I’ve tried so many music player software but the Zune desktop player have great library features (for podcasts as well, not just music) and it has excellent UI design that makes it a lot of fun.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.freemake.com/">Freemake (Audio Converter, Video Downloader, and Video Converter)</a></strong></p>

<p>While Widows Live Movie Maker and iMovie can edit movies, they can’t help with the step before that; getting some material to use in your video. You can download a YouTube video with Freemake, extract the audio track off of it, convert it to any format and then use it in your video. All free, all works really well.</p>

<h3 id="utilities">Utilities</h3>

<p><a href="http://download.cnet.com/Windows-7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool/3000-18513_4-10972600.html"><strong>Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool</strong></a></p>

<p>Copy a Windows DVD/ISO to a USB thumb drive and install Windows from it using this utility.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.filehippo.com/"><strong>FileHippo</strong></a></p>

<p>Not only a great source for applications but also its “Update Checker” can keep most of your applications up to date. Try using Scheduled Task to check for updates once a week instead of check on system startup.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.piriform.com/"><strong>CCleaner, Speecy and Defraggler</strong></a></p>

<p>All great utilities from Piriform. You can clean up caches and temp files using CCleaner. Watch out before you clean up something you might consider important like Browser History.</p>

<p>Speecy gives you a detailed report on your machine and hardware.</p>

<p>Defraggler is a really good replacement for Win Defrag.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=15155"><strong>SyncToy</strong></a></p>

<p>Very simple tool from Microsoft to keep two folders (or drives) in sync. You can <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/25046/schedule-synctoy-to-run-automatically-with-task-scheduler-in-windows-7/">use Task Scheduler to run it at specific times</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.danielnetsoftware.com/en-US/"><strong>Logon Screen</strong></a></p>

<p>I use my computer for very long hours and this simple (and nicely built) utility introduces a little change that makes it a little less boring. Here’s a <a href="http://blog.seanmartell.com/2011/04/21/nightly-and-aurora-space-quest-goodies/">nice background</a> to use on your lock screen for all Firefox fans.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.softperfect.com/products/networx/">NetWorx</a></strong></p>

<p>Small utility to keep an eye on how much bandwidth you’re using.</p>

        What I Use, Part 1
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Sep 2011</span>

    <p>One way you can tell a geek is by looking at their setup. Setup is not just computer, OS and applications, but all surrounding elements that they use on daily basis. And it’s not the elements of that setup that makes it unique but rather how they come together and the story behind each element.</p>

<p>Here’s my humble attempt to describe mine.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>I prefer desktops to laptops. For me, if you’re not using the portability of a laptop, then you’re just wasting money on an expensive piece of hardware that you can’t upgrade and risk void its warranty just by trying to open it up. While desktops are huge compared to laptops and need their own desk, they’re cheaper, easily upgradable, and can’t be left on the bus. Also, desktops are very durable. I’m in my fourth year with this machine and it’s still working very well. Yes, it has received multiple upgrades but from the outside it all looks the same.</p>

<p><strong>Case</strong><br />
<img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part1/MasterCooler03.jpg" />
I use a <a href="http://www.coolermaster-usa.com/product.php?category_id=18&amp;product_id=2700">Cooler Master 1000</a> box for my own machine. Standing in the store picking this box is a bit difficult because you don’t really realize the benefit of getting such a big box with an expensive price tag, but let me tell you, it’s worth every penny. It’s not just how quite and cool it is, and not just that it had fit all my upgrades, but it’s the little things too. I can easily tear it down, clean it up and put it back together in 2 hours, something that I like to do once every 6 months.</p>

<p>The Cooler Master comes with screwless doors and hard drive bays, removable air filters, and two long metal handles for carrying it around, not that you have to, it’s a 38 lbs box, so you might want to avoid carrying it.</p>

<p><img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part1/MasterCooler01.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>Processor</strong><br />
While I love AMD, and think that it’s very competitive with Intel. I got a very good deal on my <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/33922/Intel-Core2-Quad-Processor-Q9300-%286M-Cache-2_50-GHz-1333-MHz-FSB%29">Intel Core 2 Quad Q9300</a> (overclocked to 3.0 GHz) which was almost the latest when I got it. My strategy when getting hardware is to get the latest item when it comes to components that are long term like processors. You’re not gonna change your processor every year or two, it’s something that should live for 4 to 5 years on a day to day machine and then be moved to a secondary machine for the next 5 years. So, you get the latest product within your price range and 3 years later it’s still as powerful as the new line of products.</p>

<p>The Core 2 Quad is setting on top an ASUS Maximus RoG (Republic of Gaming) motherboard. It has excellent overclocking capabilities and great bios software, with great audio card, and plenty of all forms of ports (USB, and external SATA).</p>

<p><strong>Memory</strong><br />
I’ve started with 2 x 2GB of Corsair DDR3 RAM overclocked to 1600 MHz, I’ve followed with another 2 x 2GB to take full advantage of all slots and offer enough RAM for hosted VMs.</p>

<p><strong>Graphics Card</strong><br />
I can’t really brag too much about the Graphics card, an ATI Radeon HD 3800, because by the time you pick a graphics card and the time you reach the store to buy it, there’s already a graphics card that has been released that makes yours seems old. What I can do is say that this ATI Radeon card has worked and is still working great for me.</p>

<p><strong>Hard Drive</strong><br />
<img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part1/KingstonSSD02.jpg" />
The only thing I don’t have from the original computer that I assembled more than 3 years ago is the hard drives. All gone and replaced with new ones. Data grows at an unreasonable rate and the falling prices of hard drives tempt you into following the rule of “Don’t Delete Anything”.</p>

<p>My main backup strategy was to use RAID. If I’m gonna need a hard drive to store a copy of my data as a backup, then I would just get two of the same hard drive, make them a mirror of each other and in the process get a faster reading speed. This plan worked great to protect against hard drive failure which actually happened when one drive failed and was replaced with all data not affected. One flaw with this plan though, when I accidently chose the wrong drive when installing a new Windows, I wiped out not only the hard drive but also its mirror. In the span of the 7 seconds it took me to realize the stupid mistake that I’ve made, I had lost the partition table on both drives, and basically the map to all my data. I was able to recover my data sector by sector in a very long and painful process but the marks are still on the wall from where I banged my head as a punishment. Now, I’ve removed the RAID and just use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=15155">SyncToy</a> to sync between the two mirrors once a day to protect from hard drive failure and accidental stupidity.</p>

<p>I use a 120GB Kingston SSDNow V+100 Sold State Drive for my OS drive. The idea is always to totally separate Windows from your data. I don’t ever use “My Documents” or the desktop to store any important data (or really any data at all). The idea is that the OS can go at anytime. You can update Windows after installing this beta software and boom it’s BSOD and you can’t even go into the safe mode to figure out what the problem is. Backup will help you but restoring a 60GB of Windows is much easer than restoring 1TB of Windows and data just to get Windows working again.</p>

<p>I use a solid state drive only for the OS since they’re very expensive. However, the effect they have on boot time and startup time of applications is obvious to the naked eye. I’m still not comfortable moving to SSDs for storing data. The idea of hard drives failing without any warning signs is worrying. I’m too accustomed to physical hard drives to move to SSDs. Of course all these worries will disappear when SSDs are affordable because the difference in performance is just that obvious.</p>

<img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part1/DellMonitor03.jpg" /></p>

<p><strong>Monitors</strong><br />
One thing that laptops can’t beat for sure is multiple monitors and monitor size. I use two Dell WFP wide screen series monitors. One is 24” and the other 22”. I was surprised to know that Dell makes the best monitors but it’s true. However, I have to say that the 24” is much better than the 22”. I don’t mean in terms of size but rather color. For some reason, the white (the most obvious example) is not quite the same on the two screens. Maybe it’s the settings but I think it’s a slight difference in the model. Advice: if you want to get two or more monitors, try to get the same monitor, even if it’s not the best quality, but the consistency between the different monitors is worth it.</p>

<p>One thing I really like about these Dell monitors is the adjustable handles. You can change height, rotation, tilt without moving the base. One thing I hate about these monitors is that they make me hate my work monitor. Getting used to using two monitors with certain setup and quality makes other monitors seem awful.</p>

<p><strong>Mouse and Keyboard</strong><br />
<img class="imageInCenter" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part1/LogitechPerformanceMouseMX01.jpg" />
Logitech is your best friend here. Microsoft makes a noble effort and always comes out with new good products, but I’m super picky about the mouse and keyboard. I need to not looking at them at all and I need to do shortcut as much stuff as possible.</p>

<p>I use a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/mice-pointers/mice/devices/5845">Logitech Performance Mouse MX</a> with (an impressive) 10 buttons. Only 9 of them are programmable with 1 button physical button for fast scrolling. However, it works great for browsing, you don’t need a keyboard for going back and forward. It also works great as a remote control for media player with volume control (up, down and mute) and Play/Pause control. You’ll have to use Logitech software to program these buttons because this is not the default setting. I’ve tried so many settings until I settled on this one and you can come up with your own of course.</p>

<p><img class="imageInCenter" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part1/LogitechWave01.jpg" /></p>

<p>Logitech completes the comfort to my fingers with <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/keyboards/keyboard/devices/5994">Logitech Wave</a>. While it’s not cordless, I love the rubber pad below the keyboard where I could rest my hands. I takes a while to get used to the Home/End/Delete buttons of this keyboard and sometimes confuses you when you switch to another keyboard with two rows of 6 buttons but you’ll get used to it.</p>

<p>I don’t really use the programmed keys because I never got used to using them not on this keyboard or any other really.</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve switched to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/wireless-comfort-desktop-5000/CSD-00001">Microsoft Comfort Desktop 5000</a> which have a very nice wireless keyboard that is much quitter than the Logitech, but I’m not too crazy about the mouse. Still, nothing beats a 10-buttons mouse.</p>

<p><img class="imageInCenter" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part1/MicrosoftComfortDesktop01.jpg" /></p>

<p>I have another PC that I use as a file server and to store my backups. AMD is the perfect balance between getting stuff done and doing it on the cheap.</p>

<p><strong>Phone</strong><br />
<img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/WhatIUse2011Part1/SamsungFocus01.jpg" />
Some people think it’s tough being a Windows Phone guy. You’re surrounded by a lot of iPhone, Android and Blackberry fan boys who can’t stop telling you how great their phones are. For me, even though I’m surrounded by those people (the only people I know who have a Windows Phone are on Twitter). However, it’s really easy having a Windows Phone. It plays really well with all the Microsoft services that I use. But more importantly, I think that Microsoft struck a nice balance between iPhone and Android. WP7 (Windows Phone 7) is easy to use and fast like an iPhone and is open and easy to develop to like Android. Before you hate me for comparing WP7 to your favorite mobile platform, I’m just saying that it’s taking the best of both worlds and not copying anyone. Actually, one thing I really like about WP7 is that it didn’t copy iPhone UI which was super cool when it first came out but now is very old compared to the Metro UI of WP7.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/cell-phones/SGH-I917ZKAATT">Samsung Focus</a> phone which is super light and has a great screen.</p>

<p>This post was supposed to describe all my setup, but it ran very long so I’ll break into multiple posts. This was most of my hardware, next up will be the software. Hopefully soon.</p>

        How to fix WLW Backup problem with Windows x64
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Sep 2011</span>

    <p><img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/HowToFixWlwBackupProblemWithWindowsx64/Windows_Live_Writer_logo.png" />
I, like most bloggers out there, love Windows Live Writer. One problem I have with it is that I have to set it up whenever I re-install Windows. Long ago I found that I can backup all my posts (recently posted and drafts) just copying the two folders “Drafts” and “Recent Posts” from the folder  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C:\Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\Documents\My Weblog Posts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, I wanted to backup more than that. I wanted to backup my blog configurations and other settings. So, I searched a little bit (using <a href="http://www.kngine.com/">Kngine</a> which is great, give it a try) and I found <a href="http://wlwbackup.codeplex.com/">WLW Backup tool</a> that can backup blog settings, drafts, recent posts, and plugins. The link I’ve listed here is for the project on CodePlex where the project went open source by its developer <a href="http://scottisafool.wordpress.com/">Scott Lovegrover</a>.</p>

<p>Before I found this latest version I downloaded version 2.0 and tried to backup my WLW settings and an error occurred.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>System.BadImageFormatException: Could not load file or assembly ‘CabLib, Version=6.9.26.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null’ or one of its dependencies. An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format.<br />
File name: ‘CabLib, Version=6.9.26.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The application comes in two simple assemblies LiveWriterBackup.exe and CabLib.dll (and two icons). <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/files/CABCompressExtract.aspx">CabLib.dll</a> is compression and extraction library that LiveWriterBackup.exe is using to compress all the backed up files into one file. This was a .NET exception, so I got interested and started to try to fix the problem. Reading the error, it seems like LiveWriterBackup.exe can’t find CabLib.dll. A bit of searching, and I found that <a href="http://sharepoint400.blogspot.com/2011/02/could-not-load-file-or-assembly-cablib.html">some SharePoint developers</a> were having the same problem with the CabLib.dll file. They fixed it by replacing the CabLib.dll with the x64 version. I tried that but now I got a new error:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly ‘CabLib, Version=6.9.26.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null’ or one of its dependencies. The located assembly’s manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems like the two assemblies didn’t really match. Instead of getting around it, I needed to fix the actual problem. Why can’t LiveWriterBackup.exe find CabLib.dll? Maybe there’s a bug with the application itself. I decided to look inside. I fired up <a href="http://www.telerik.com/products/decompiler.aspx">JustDecompile</a> and loaded the LiveWriterBackup.exe. The executable have a direct reference to CabLib.dll and don’t have any assumptions other than how .NET assemblies <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/15hyw9x3%28v=VS.100%29.aspx">find other assemblies</a>.</p>

<p>Back to search. Remove some search words and try different combinations. Then I found the solution on a <a href="http://www.cnblogs.com/atfield/archive/2009/04/03/1429286.html">Chinese blog</a>.<br />
<img class="imageOnRight" src="/public/images/HowToFixWlwBackupProblemWithWindowsx64/clip_image006[4].jpg" />
God bless Google translation which <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=zh-CN&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnblogs.com%2Fatfield%2Farchive%2F2009%2F04%2F03%2F1429286.html">came to the rescue</a>. The problem wasn’t in the CabLib.dll but rather in LiveWriterBackup.exe which was built with the setting “Any CPU” on a 32bit machine so all it’s testing went okey. But when tried on a 64bit machine like mine, it actually ran as a 64bit application trying to call a 32bit CabLib.dll. You can see that in the screenshot of Task Manager. You can see 32bit applications have a *32 next to them while the LiveWriterBackup.exe process doesn’t.</p>

<p>So the solution is get an executable that is built for 32 bit configurations. Or we just use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms164699%28VS.80%29.aspx">Corflags</a>. It’s a tool that allows you to configure the CorFlags section of the header of an executable. It’s what Rafeel Rivera was referring to in his <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HanselminutesPodcastEpisodeRollup273Through280GlimpseJavaScriptKinectScriptPolyGlotAzureWindowsAndGraphDatabases.aspx">recording</a> (listen <a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=299">here</a>) with Scott Hanselman as “flipping bits” which seems to be a known term. Here’s “<em><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/joshwil/archive/2005/05/06/415191.aspx">Flipping bits on managed images to make them load with the right bitness</a></em>”  </p>

<p>I just browsed using the command line to the location of the Corflags executable (C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Bin) and I ran the command  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Corflags “C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Live Writer Backup\LiveWriterBackup.exe” /32BIT+</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tried again to backup settings and it worked. Testing on x64 machines is necessary as x64 machines are becoming more and more popular. Also, try not to build to “Any CPU” unless you test on all CPUs. More importantly, when debugging try to know the bitness of all the participating assemblies that are causing trouble.</p>

<p>Happy debugging.</p>

    <p>When I hear all the news about all the new app stores for the big three (Apple, Google and Microsoft), all I can think of is Opera giving away cars to her audience. “You get a Car, You get a Car, You get a Car. Every …body … gets … a … Car”. Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcI-rHO0yko">video</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, giant platform-developing software companies don’t really need cars, it seems like they’re making up for it with App Stores.</p>

<p>iPhone has an <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/apps-for-iphone/">App Store</a>, so Windows Mobile got a Marketplace. Google Chrome got a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a> (this one – in particular – I’ll get to in a minute). On Thursday Jan. 6, Apple launched the <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store/">Mac App Store</a>. Microsoft built a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/apps/default.aspx">Marketplace for Windows Phone 7</a> and is <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/article/paul-thurrotts-wininfo/New-Tile-Based-Shell-App-Model-and-App-Store-Coming-in-Windows-8-.aspx">rumored to create an App Store for Windows 8</a>.</p>

<p>I can easily see the benefits of having an App Store. For beginner users, it makes it very easy to find, install and maintain applications. Also, I can easily see app stores be a big success. An obvious example is the iPhone App Store, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store#Number_of_launched_applications">300,000+ apps with 7,000,000,000+ downloads</a>.</p>

<p>This, of course, comes with a cost. Mostly paid by the app developers, not by the store owner. For example, Apple takes away 30% off the payment for all downloads through the app store. It’s the software equivalent of taxes. Beyond hosting your app, its updates, and including it in the search results, I’m not sure what the cost is for.</p>

<p>Then comes the Guidelines. For you to include any app to Apple’s app store (iPhone or Mac), your app have go through an approval process where you submit it to Apple where it would be reviewed and either accepted or rejected. Apple provides feedback on the reason why your app was rejected. Developers had different experience with the review process over time. In Sept. 2010, Apple released official guidelines for the review process which seems like a no brainer for such a process but somehow was delayed all this time.</p>

<p>Just like GUI (with Macintosh), and cell phones (with the iPhone), with the app review process, Apple has revolutionized Censorship. Somehow, Apple managed to make censorship cool. Look at it, unshaved, with a black turtleneck, it’s so cool and we all have to abide by it.</p>

<p>But nothing fascinates me more than <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a>. Wait, don’t click the link, you have to install Chrome browser first to be able to “install” any of the “apps” (wink wink). I have to say, it’s an admirable effort by Google to put together – by far – the most fancy bookmark collection I have ever seen.</p>

<p>How bad is the Chrome Web Store. The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blpcfgokakmgnkcojhhkbfbldkacnbeo">YouTube app</a> of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube website</a>, which is the largest video-sharing website, a <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Google_purchases_YouTube_for_$1.65_billion">$1.65 billion</a> valued website that got its own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN-YouTube_presidential_debates">presidential debates</a>. Yes, that YouTube got only 3 out of 5 stars on Chrome web store and one of the comments says it all “Nice link”.</p>

<p>Microsoft, as usual, late but eventually better decided to have its own App Store. Not only for the newly released Windows Phone 7, but also for Windows. Of course, they call it “Marketplace” because if they call it App Store, we might think it’s the exact same thing as Apple’s.</p>

<p>In the case of smart phones, since their beginning they had app stores and people got used to the idea of installing all their apps through the app store. Users have nothing to compare it to. Developers never tried to go outside the guidelines because what’s the point of developing an app that you know will be rejected by the only distribution channel available. It’s a loss that developers’ innovation be restricted like this under the banner of consistent user experience and application stability.</p>

<p>In the case of desktops, users do have something to compare app stores to. Developers have always worked with no guidelines to restrict what they can do with applications. Yes, this has caused applications like viruses, Trojans, and key loggers to be developed. But, these are a tiny fraction of all the applications that were developed and we can’t live without today.</p>

<p><a href="http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2011/01/08/vlc-for-iphone-and-ipad-get-pulled-from-the-app-store/">Apple has pulled VLC from its App Store</a>. VLC is an application that is essential to any computer that plays video. So when it gets pulled or rejected, it will get it’s own post on all tech blogs. But what about Joe Developer who develops the next killer app. His application won’t get a blog post when it gets rejected because Joe didn’t exactly follow the guidelines of the app store, and Joe doesn’t have a way of distributing this application other than the app store. Even if he does manage to find another distribution channel, it won’t get him the visibility of being on the vendor’s app store.</p>

<p>App Store Can’t be Walled Gardens. They don’t need just to have <a href="http://wmpoweruser.com/windows-phone-7-marketplace-search-updated/">better search</a>, or <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5403986/itunes-enters-the-web-browser-with-itunes-preview">access through a browser</a>. They need to be Open. Open to developers with no ridiculous sign up fees, or commission on every download. Open with no guidelines that <a href="http://developer.apple.com/appstore/guidelines.html">require me to sign up just to read it</a>. App stores can implement a system of recommendation where you can “Strongly Oppose” the apps you don’t like but don’t make a choice for me as a user.</p>

<p>If the purpose of App Stores is to offer a central point for distributing software to users, then let’s make that. But if the purpose is to make a new revenue generator, and turn platforms and its applications into a software that runs extensions and addons, then we all, developers and users, are screwed.</p>
