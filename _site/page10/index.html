        GIS, GPS, LBS, and GeoWeb: They're different, People
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 May 2008</span>

    <p>When I tell anyone one that I work in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">GIS</a> and tell them about what it’s about, I always get the response of "Oh, I know what that is, it’s the little screen in my car with the navigator". No people, that’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a>. Smarter responses include "Is that part of GPS?" and "Yeah, I know what that is, I use Google Maps". But All of that is still not GIS. So, I’m gonna write this down for one last time and the next person to ask me about what I’m doing for living, I’ll just give him the link for this post.</p>

<p><strong>GPS</strong></p>

<p>Let’s start with the most known one, GPS. The Global Positioning System is a network of satellites that orbits around the earth at let a receiver device determine its location, speed, direction, and time. The receiver device (which is commonly known as "GPS") needs to be connected to at least 4 satellites to determine its location, and hence speed, direction and time. GPS is an American system, and it’s the only completely implemented global navigation satellite system. There are other GNSS like Russian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLONASS">GLONASS</a>, European <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_positioning_system">Galileo</a>, the proposed Chinese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMPASS_navigation_system">COMPASS</a>, and Indian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Regional_Navigational_Satellite_System">IRNSS</a>. GPS devices are now widely, not just used but also, integrated into other devices like cars, smart phones, and cameras.</p>

<p><strong>GIS</strong></p>

<p>Geographic Information System is the implementation of database for spatial data. If a database can have text, numbers, dates, and photos, it can have maps as well. It’s not just about the location, it’s about querying the location and analyzing that location with respect to other locations. It’s just like querying and analyzing tabular data. The only difference is that if a picture is worth a thousand words, a map is worth a thousand pictures. </p>

<p>GIS is a mix of science (Geography), information systems, and modern software technologies that hasn’t - unfortunately - exploit the potentials of GIS yet, but hopefully one day it will.</p>

<p><strong>GeoWeb</strong></p>

<p>This is the new buzz, and I think we owe the credit to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole,_Inc.">Keyhole</a>. Keyhole was the company that created the software that we know now as Google Earth. In 2004, Google acquired Keyhole and changed their paid software to a free software that we all use now.</p>

<p>It was Google Earth and its user generated content that required the creation of this new term "GeoWeb". GeoWeb is basically to provide a geographic dimension to the information on the web. You want to find a house in your area, but what really defines "Your Area", it’s where you think is close to you and you can’t define that unless you use a map.</p>

<p>Even though GeoWeb is the natural evolution of GIS - It’s GIS for the public, where everyone can search, add, or analyze spatial-based information -, the GeoWeb didn’t come from a GIS software company but rather a company founded only in 2001.</p>

<p><strong>LBS</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location-based_service">Location Based Services</a> is the product of GIS, GPS, GeoWeb, and mobile computing. Here’s a scenario of what LBS can offer, you’re on the go and you want to find the nearest favorite sports store, you pick up your cell phone and connect to the Internet to get that info, easy, then you get directions to the store and as you move, the cell phone adjusts the route and suggests other routs depending on the traffic and how long is the route, still easy. As you approach the store you get a message telling you that there’s another sports store near by that is offering 50% discount on exactly what you’re looking for. Now, that’s not easy. Of course there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location-based_service#LBS_applications">other applications</a> to LBS, but this is one of its most widely known ones. It’s about offering the right information at the right time in the right location so you can act on it immediately, and if that info is an ad, that mean there gonna be <a href="http://www.google.com">people</a> looking forward for LBS.</p>

<p>Google has been working building an <a href="http://gigaom.com/2006/08/15/google-launches-wifi-network-in-mountain-view/">alternative</a> to LBS that can be implemented now. Based on a free widely available WiFi network, Google can distribute ads to those logging in to the network with their Google account.</p>

<p>Downside, Privacy. LBS - in my opinion as one whose working in GIS - is a major violation of privacy. It’s not just that the service providers know who you are and what you’re interested in, but also where you are and where you’ve been. Your location is identified in real time but also could be logged very easily. And who knows who’s listening.</p>

<p><strong>Anyway</strong>, forget about the differences between the technical terms. One thing is for sure, Location is next big buzz.</p>

        Microsoft vs. Google: Is it a real fight?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 May 2008</span>

    <p>I think it would be fair to say that there seem to be a competition going on between Microsoft and Google. It’s ridiculous to deny it since Microsoft is making all of those moves to compete with Google (Enhancing <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/desktopsearch/default.mspx">Windows</a> Search, Ballmer <a href="http://web-advertising.suite101.com/article.cfm/microsoft_advertising_strategy">announcing</a> that 25% of Microsoft revenues would come from advertising, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/aug07/08-13MSaQuantivePR.mspx">acquisition</a> of aQuantive for 6B$, and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/feb08/02-01CorpNewsPR.mspx">offer</a> to buy Yahoo! for more than 44B$). Even though the two companies doesn’t share much of battlegrounds (search and online advertising, which both represent a fraction of Microsoft revenues), The two companies - especially Microsoft - seem to be more concerned with one another more and more. Why is that?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A few years back when Google was on the rise, the question "How can stop Google?" was naturally followed by "Could it be Microsoft?". The collision of the two powers is a natural course of events, and Microsoft is thinking "let’s do it now before Google <a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/5/google_to_surpass_size_of_microsoft_windows_in_2009">gets too big</a> to handle".</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Google expanding its products to provide cheap (free is cheap, right?) only-core-widely-used-features everywhere-accessible alternatives to Microsoft products (for example, Google Docs vs Office) is threatening Microsoft future revenues. It kinda feels like Netscape replacing windows all over again. Microsoft is thinking "It’s not about generating more profit, it’s a matter of national security".</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The business model offered by Google, a company offering free products that makes millions of dollars, is more effective than Microsoft traditional-software-company business model. Microsoft is thinking "Adopt it or beat it, or maybe adopt it and beat everybody else".</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Google’s products are the closest thing to Microsoft’s Software-as-a-Service licensing model that was supposed to replace the traditional license model currently used. Microsoft is probably thinking "Those Google guys stole my idea and they’re making money of it, I’ll #&amp;jlk%fn&amp;h!i* them".</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Online advertising is generating more profit everyday. Microsoft is thinking "Why not get a bigger piece of the pie".</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Well, we’ve established that there is a fight. But how real is it?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Microsoft can avoid the <a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/5/google_to_surpass_size_of_microsoft_windows_in_2009#comment-4829b325796c7a88001709b4">"If Google is winning, then we must be losing"</a> attitude which seem be driving the company lately, like the Microhoo merger that will take at least a year to be active because of all the in-house arrangements that has to happen. Stopping that attitude will make the fight look much less intense.*   Microsoft should take a moment and re-plan its online strategy, at least to avoid all the redundant services (for example, <a href="https://www.foldershare.com/welcome.aspx">Folder Share</a>, <a href="http://skydrive.live.com/">SkyDrive</a>, and <a href="https://www.mesh.com/Welcome/Welcome.aspx">Live Mesh</a>). This might give Microsoft’s effort in online services a chance to compete with Google in that area.*   Even though online advertising is driving Google’s revenues, Google’s services is what’s threatening Microsoft. And while it’s a good strategy to directly compete in online advertising which will dry Google funds for building those services, it’s still sufficient to build better services - or software - to limit Google services’ affect on Microsoft revenues.</li>
</ul>

<p>How real is the fight, if someone came out on top.. then, it’s real.</p>

    <p>As you use the Internet on daily basis, either in work or home or both, for business or pleasure, you spend more and more time in front of your browser. Over the last month, I’ve been trying to cut down the time I spend on daily activities on the Internet. Here are some of the tools that helped me do that and others that introduce some really great benefits that might come in handy for you too..</p>

<p><strong>Essential Tools</strong></p>

        Windows 7: What it's Rumored to Have, and What It should Have
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Dec 2007</span>

    <p>As the year is coming to an end, everyone is gazing into the future and making predictions for 2008. So, I thought I’d gaze a little into the future of Windows..</p>

<p>Windows 7 is the codename for the next windows version, as you all might know by now. Until now, number of features of the next windows has been <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071112-early-windows-7-feature-list-leaked-to-the-public.html?rel">leaked</a>/<a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071218-reality-check-what-we-know-and-dont-about-windows-7.html">rumored</a> recently, even <a href="http://apcmag.com/7668/beyond_vista_windows_7_what_we_know_so_far">some snapshots were claimed to of windows 7</a>. The list contains some obvious, known, demanded, and - of course - copied features, like:</p>

<p><strong>1. Virtual machines for legacy software:</strong> one of the main reasons for the late adoption for Vista by users is for incompatibility for most software. And as Windows team would want to make larger modifications in the OS, they should worry more about this issue. Apple people had a similar situation when moving from OS 9 to OS X, to overcome this they had "Classic" programs run in a virtual machine mode. With the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Server_2008#Hyper-V">Hyper-V</a> feature in the new Windows Server 2008, it’s possible for Microsoft to think about including a virtual machine mode to run classic programs too. This would give the development team the advantage of making as much modifications as they want.</p>

<p><strong>2. New smaller kernel:</strong> Vista is installed in almost 14GB (just the windows folder on my machine) unlike XP that is around 3GB, if we’re going to continue on this ratio.. we’ll be seeing a 100GB OS soon. It’s not about hard disk size, HDs gets more GBs every year with cheaper prices. It’s about re-building the core of system instead modifying the existing one. Microsoft didn’t change much of the core of windows since NT, maybe it’s time to do so.</p>

<p><strong>3. **<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinFS">**WinFS**</a></strong>:** Microsoft promised to include WinFS in Vista and they didn’t. WinFS is as fancy idea as it’s wanted. WinFS is announced to be included in ADO.NET Entity Framework and SQL Server 2008. In November 2006, Steve Ballmer <a href="http://www.crn.com/software/196600671">said</a> that WinFS will be integrated in the windows codebase after the development has fully completed, which should be in time for Windows 7.</p>

<p><strong>4. Entirely new look:</strong> Vista got a new GUI , Areo, with significant new look, but the experience is the same as XP. Microsoft should inspect the real needs of the users and modify the experience to fit that, like they did in Office 2007. Luckily enough, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/ssinofsky/default.mspx">Steven Sinofsky</a> who is the Senior Vice President for the Windows Engineering Group, was responsible for developing Office 2007. Maybe he’ll do the same in the new position..</p>

<p><strong>5. De-coupling the interface from the explorer shell:</strong> sounds like a complicated inner behind-the-scene feature, but actually this would affect the user interface in a great way. Now, you can change the whole interface and still make full benefit of the shell.</p>

<p><strong>6. Multi-touch Support:</strong> with Microsoft Surface going from research to production and Support for Tablet-PCs, Supporting Multi-touch in windows seems like a good idea.</p>

<p>That’s what Windows 7 is most likely to have according to number of articles, but what it should have..</p>

<p><strong>1. Better file operation management:</strong> Don’t you just hate how XP is handling copy operations. If you don’t, try to copy two files in parallel rather than in sequence, it’ll take you almost twice as much time. Or try to copy/move a large folder to another drive and after half an hour you get this message that there’s no enough space. What if you left your machine and came back in an hour assuming that copying is in progress but actually it’s not. Also, There’s the un-explainable waiting before displaying the confirmation message when trying to delete a large number of files. Well, that was in XP, what about Vista? I tell you, it’s even worse.. I miss the good old days of XP when it comes to copying. In Vista, you can’t rename/delete/move any file on the System drive without getting all those confirmation messages (at least 3 messages). And it’s also slow, and when I say slow, I mean sloooooow. Of course, I don’t need to mention the crazy estimated time counter, One time, <a href="http://microsoft.blognewschannel.com/archives/2007/12/07/vista-file-copying-is-blazing-fast/">Vista indicated that it needs 129 years to complete the remaining 7.55MB</a>.</p>

<p>It’s not that hard to have better copy operation. Check out those copy managers like <a href="http://www.copyhandler.com/en/downloads/4.html">Copy Handler</a>, and <a href="http://www.ranvik.net/totalcopy/">Total Copy</a>. That’s not impossible to do, right? Copy operations in windows needs Pause and Resume capabilities, better handling for parallel copying, fault tolerance for network failure when copying over network or for removable devices, Minimize to tray button, centralized window for all operations and maybe history recording, and to put more human common sense in the sequence of messages.</p>

<p><strong>2. Less/No **<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control">**UAC (User Account Control)**</a></strong> pop-ups:** If you didn’t hear about UAC and how it operates, expect a moment of panic when your first UAC message pop up. But don’t worry, you’ll get used to it, as more and more are coming your way.</p>

<p>For those how hasn’t experienced UAC, here’s how it work. The screen turns to black in the same way it turns off, and then in about a moment everything is grayed and here’s your UAC message, why the suspense? and for what? No UAC message has ever warned me about something I don’t know, instead it treats Visual Studio 2005, VMware Workstation, and Real Player as they’re programs that are about to violate my machine.</p>

<p>Of course, the principle idea behind UAC is running applications processes in a standard user privileges until the user grant them higher privileges. But, it’s handled very badly as a user experience and most importantly, Applications still not playing nicely with it. Microsoft is putting avoiding UAC messages as an essential part in their conditions to grant application the "Certified for Vista" logo. But that’s just for small companies or close partners to Microsoft, other wise, the user has face those messages on daily basis.</p>

<p><strong>3. Less minimum requirements:</strong> One of the primary reasons for Vista’s low distribution numbers is the high configurations that are set as minimum requirements for running the OS. And don’t get fooled with the "Vista Capable" statement, this’s just mean that you’re gonna be running the OS, but we’re not sure about other programs. To run Vista in a comfortable way, you need a dual core processor, and 2GB of RAM, not to mention a upper-medium graphics card.</p>

<p>It’s not that difficult to expect when new hardware will be available, and when it will be mainstream. The hardware (Processors, Memory, and Graphic Cards like Intel, AMD, MSI, and those people) companies and PCs (Desktop and laptops like HP, Dell, and Toshiba) companies, they have road maps for these things and they can tell you if you lunch an OS in 2010 what kind of configuration will be available. If Microsoft took couple of hours to search on the Internet for these information (even without using <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>), you should be able to fix the Vista hardware mistake.</p>

<p><strong>4. Themes:</strong> Microsoft promised to enable themes in both XP and Vista, but didn’t deliver. Large number of applications are allowing themes and actually helping developers and designers building themes, and also a large number of applications are turning to web applications which can change their looks every now and then or even allowing personalization. Microsoft should keep their promise this time, if they make one..</p>

<p><strong>5. .NET framework built into Windows core:</strong> The idea behind the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime">CLR</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JIT compilation</a> of the .net framework is to allow converting written code in the time of execution to the code appropriate to the platform which the application is running on, like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">Java Virtual Machine</a>. But wait a minute, Isn’t Microsoft only releasing .net framework for the Windows platform. Yes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Source_Common_Language_Infrastructure">they’re sharing source of the CLI</a> and Novell is building <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_%28software%29">Mono</a> but .net applications are not really platform independent. On the other hand, Maybe Microsoft’s perfect chance to push the .net as a development option for commercial software (and not just solutions) built by enterprises is to play their favorite move and integrate .net into the core of Windows.</p>

<p>If Microsoft pushed the framework into the core of the system and done it right, maybe that’s will help overcoming the performance problem known for the .net applications.</p>

<p>I don’t know if this is possible or not, but maybe it’s worth thinking about.</p>

<p>What do you think.. what would you like the next windows version, Windows 7, to have.. let us know..</p>

        How Firefox Makes Money
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Dec 2007</span>

    <p>Ever wondered how firefox is still running even though all of Mozilla’s products are for free..</p>

<p>First, it must be denotations, the “Best Browser Implementing Web Standards” - according to Mozilla - must be receiving lots of denotations from its wide user base. But There are actually two Mozillas, the Foundation and the Corporation.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation">Foundation</a> is a non-profit organization that handles the leadership for the open source Mozilla project, the polices, key infrastructure, trademarks and that stuff. Its revenue is tax-exempt status under the U.S. tax code as it’s based in Mountain View, California.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation">Corporation</a> is a subsidiary of the foundation that coordinates the development of internet-related applications such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox">firefox</a>. It also depends on denotations but there’s also a deal with Google that whenever a user uses that little search box on the top right and he/she clicks an ad in the search results offered by Google, Mozilla gets 80% of the revenue. That little box is <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2006/03/06/firefox-mozilla-corporation-mozilla-foundation-made-72m-last/">rumored</a> to had made $72M last year. It’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation">confirmed</a> (by Wikipedia, read the Financing section) that $61.5M were Mozilla’s revenues in 2006 because of the little box out of a total $66.8M of revenues.</p>

<p>It’s good to see Mozilla going strong financially as they are technically. Looks like the red fox is gonna be sticking around for a while.. bad news for the guys in Redmond..</p>
