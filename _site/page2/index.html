        How to Turn XML Schema (XSD) to Documentation
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2013</span>

    <p><a href="/public/images/TurnXsdToHtml/VSXmlSchemaEditor-big.png"><img style="float: right" src="/public/images/TurnXsdToHtml/VSXmlSchemaEditor.png" /></a></p>

<p>Today, a colleague at work was trying to modify a configuration file in XML format. He wasn’t sure what were the available options for a certain attribute, so we started looking for an answer.   <br />
The XML configuration file came with a software product and had an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSD">XSD file</a>. For me as a developer, I opened the XSD file in Visual Studio and used the XML Schema Editor (shown on the right) to browse its content.   <br />
However, for him installing Visual Studio wasn’t the best option especially if he wanted to forward more information to a client and let them modify configurations themselves. So, we did a little more digging.   <br />
<a href="http://wiki.fiforms.org/index.php/Xs3p">Xs3p</a> is a schema documentation generator. It’s simply an XSLT stylesheet, which generates HTML documentation from an XSD schema file.   <br />
You can download Xs3p <a href="http://xml.fiforms.org/xs3p/">here</a> or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xs3p/files/xs3p-1.1.5.zip/download">direct link</a> to version 1.1.5   <br />
 Extract the content of the downloaded ZIP file and place it a folder. We’ll use the file <em>xs3p.xsl</em>  <br />
On Windows, you can use MSXML (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15697">Download</a>) and the MSXSL command utility (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21714">Download</a>).   <br />
To use MSXSL, place the downloaded EXE in the same folder as the extracted ZIP file. In the command line browse to that folder, then type a command like this:     </p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/6385853.js"></script>

<p>Where: <em>myXsd.xsd</em> is the name of the XSD file. <em>myXsdDocumentation.html</em> is the name of the HTML file that will be generated by the tool.
        I assume that all three files (XSD, XSL, and output HTML) along with MSXSL.exe are placed in the same folder.   <br />
Here’s what the output looks like:
<a href="/public/images/TurnXsdToHtml/SampleOutput-big.png"><img src="/public/images/TurnXsdToHtml/SampleOutput.png" alt="" /></a>
You can download view <a href="/public/images/TurnXsdToHtml/SampleOutputOfMsXslTool.html">sample HTML output</a>.<br />
To make things easier, I wrote a <a href="/public/images/TurnXsdToHtml/ConvertAllXsdToHtml.ps1">PowerShell script</a> that find all the XSD files in the folder where it’s placed and convert them all to HTML. It assumes that both <em>MSXSL.exe</em> and <em>xs3p.xsl</em> are in the same folder.
        To use the script, from the command line run this command:     </p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/6386132.js"></script>

<p>Here’s the script:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/6386145.js"></script>

<p>This <a href="/public/images/TurnXsdToHtml/TurnXmlSchemaToHtml.zip">ZIP file</a> include all three files: PowerShell script, <em>MSXSL.exe</em> and style sheet <em>xs3p.xsl</em>.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

        Upgrade Windows Font for Better Arabic Readability
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2013</span>

    <p>I was testing Windows 8.1 when I saw something that I liked very much; better Arabic font. I wasn’t going to wait to upgrade all my machines to Windows 8.1 (if I ever do) to get that font. So, I went searching for the reason. I found that Microsoft upgraded the SegoeUI font. Spot the difference in Windows Explorer:</p>

<p><a href="/public/images/UpgradeArabicFont/ArabicFont-FilesInWinExplorer-BeforeAndAfter-big.png"><img style="float: center" src="/public/images/UpgradeArabicFont/ArabicFont-FilesInWinExplorer-BeforeAndAfter.png" /></a></p>

<p>.. and in Firefox tab headers:</p>

<p><a href="/public/images/UpgradeArabicFont/ArabicFont-HeaderInFirefox-BeforeAndAfer.png"><img style="float: center" src="/public/images/UpgradeArabicFont/ArabicFont-HeaderInFirefox-BeforeAndAfer.png" /></a></p>

<p>To install this font, backup the old font first by going to the Fonts section in the Control Panel and copying all the Segoe fonts.</p>

<p><a href="/public/images/UpgradeArabicFont/BackupSegoeFont-big.png"><img style="float: center" src="/public/images/UpgradeArabicFont/BackupSegoeFont.png" /></a></p>

<p><a href="/public/images/UpgradeArabicFont/Windows 8 SegoeUI Fonts.zip">Download</a> the new font.</p>

<p>Extract the ZIP file and install it. Just right click all the extracted files and choose Install.
You’ll be asked to replace the old font, click Yes.</p>

        Add RTL Support and Web Fonts to Tumblr Posts
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 May 2013</span>

    <p><a href="/public/images/RtlSupportInTumblr/ArabicTumblr_thumb.png"><img style="float: right" src="/public/images/RtlSupportInTumblr/ArabicTumblr_thumb.png" /></a>
This is my technical blog. My <a href="http://amreldib.tumblr.com/">personal blog</a>, where I write mostly in my native Arabic, is hosted on Tumblr which is a nice platform but is really bad in supporting Arabic and other RTL languages. At least that’s my experience.</p>

<p>So finally I got sick of it and decided that I’m gonna fix this with some HTML and CSS magic. Maybe with <a href="http://rtl-this.com/tutorial/how-rtl-your-tumblr-theme">some help</a>. I did find that Tumblr has some nice features that helps fixing the problem. Let’s see how.</p>

<p>Tumblr lets you modify the HTML and insert additional CSS to your page. You gotta be careful when you’re doing this. At least make a backup of your page before you try new changes.</p>

<p>One nice feature is that you can add <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes">{TagsAsClasses}</a> as a CSS class. This will allow Tumblr to read the tags you attach to your post and apply them as a CSS class. I’ll use this as a way of marking the Arabic posts that I’d like to display from Right-to-Left. For every one of these posts, I’ll add the tag “arabic” and then Tumblr will apply the CSS class to that post.</p>

<p>I’ve used a simple theme named <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/theme/9601">Quite Big</a> as my base theme. You’ll find a DIV with the classes “content” and “<em>x</em>-post”. x-post is not the name of a class but rather text-post, photo-post, quote-post, and link-post. One class for each type of post.</p>

<p><a href="/public/images/RtlSupportInTumblr/TumblrPostsTypes_thumb.png"><img style="float: right" src="/public/images/RtlSupportInTumblr/TumblrPostsTypes_thumb.png" /></a></p>

<p>You’ll need to find each one of these DIVs and add “{TagsAsClasses}” to its CSS classes.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/5519226.js"></script>

<h3 id="wait-where-can-i-get-the-html">Wait, where can I get the HTML?</h3>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/settings">Settings</a> section, click on the item at the bottom of the list on the left where you should see your avatar. Next to “Theme”, click “Customize”.
On the left, you’ll find “Edit HTML”.</p>

<p>After you save the modified HTML. While in the “Customize” mode, scroll down to the bottom in the pane on the left. You’ll find a “Add Custom CSS” section. This is where we’ll add a definition of how we want to display the Arabic posts.</p>

<p>{TagsAsClasses} allows us to add a tag to any post and apply it as a CSS class. The name of the CSS class must match the name of the tag. In my case, I chose “arabic”. Here’s the CSS I used.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/5519240.js"></script>

<p>This will apply the RTL direction, it will align the text to the right, and make the font size a little bit bigger.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-web-fonts">How to Use Web Fonts?</h3>

<p>Now that I went through the posts and added the “arabic” tag and everything is right to left. I need a good font to really make the blog look beautiful. Nothing pleases me when I’m writing Arabic like the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/amiri/">Amiri font</a>. Since it’s available on <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/earlyaccess">Google Web Fonts</a>, this makes my task much easier.</p>

<p>First, I import Amiri.css. I go back to the HTML of my pages. Before the very end of the <strong><em>&lt;style&gt;</em></strong> element in the <strong><em>&lt;head&gt;</em></strong> (search for <strong><em>&lt;/style&gt;</em></strong> and place the next line right before it):</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/5519244.js"></script>

<p>Then I got back to the additional CSS, and slightly modify the CSS to look like this:</p>

<p>I notice the headers need a little bit of a change. They don’t have the right font. So, I go back to the HTML, and find the H3 element for the titles, and change it to look like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/5519249.js"></script>

<p>Then modify the CSS to look like this:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/5519196.js"></script>

<p>Now, the headers and the body are using Amiri and the header has the right size.</p>

<p>I’ve published the <a href="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/5519192">modified HTML file</a> on a GitHub gist if you want to use the same theme. Here is the <a href="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/5519196">additional CSS</a>. </p>

<p>Recently, I’ve attended a developers’ conference and some of the sessions were a model for how to deliver a passionless boring lecture done so nicely that the only thing interrupting was the noise of my snoring. I wanted to sum up few of the great lessons I’ve learnt from these great sessions.</p>

<h3 id="start-with-the-obligatory-pointless-show-of-hands">1. Start with the Obligatory Pointless Show of Hands</h3>

<p>Nothing engages the audience more than feeling small when asked “Have you heard of JavaScript?” except feeling inadequate when asked “Did anyone try scaling AngularJS with MongoDB using Chrome Canary on Linux Mint?”. But this feeling of engagement quickly builds up when you completely ignore the results of the quick poll and carry on with your session without the slightest modification. Show-of-hands shows that you are down with the latest tricks in the art of presenting.</p>

<h3 id="speak-in-soft-emotionless-monotone">2. Speak in Soft Emotionless Monotone</h3>

<p>Developers’ emotions have devolved over the years because of the constant contact with machines. Showing any emotion might be dangerous, and it’s completely unnecessary. Use a soft monotone that makes all the words sound alike.</p>

<h3 id="sit-down-and-hide-behind-your-laptop">3. Sit down and Hide behind your Laptop</h3>

<p>You’re a busy person who’s been working all day on your hippy standing desk. Feel comfortable sitting behind your monitor and let your soft voice guide your audience through the slides that need no character.</p>

<h3 id="list-facts-not-experiences">4. List Facts, not Experiences</h3>

<p>Your audience traveled hundreds, if not thousands, of miles to learn the facts that they could’ve read in a blog post. They just need it in the form of unsorted incoherent list that is difficult to remember and makes no sense. Make sure to deliver it fast enough so that they can break for launch. If you list 20 facts is better than if they can remember 10.</p>

<h3 id="avoid-story-lines-or-building-up-to-something-meaningful">5. Avoid Story lines or Building up to Something Meaningful</h3>

<p>Stories means emotions. Stories have highs and lows. Stories are interesting. Stories are not facts. Stories are coherent. These are all things we’re trying to avoid.</p>

<h3 id="jokes-are-for-suckers">6. Jokes are for Suckers</h3>

<p>It’s very important to put a distance between you and your audience, not just physical distance but emotional as well. You are a delivery vessel for facts, you’re not there to entertain or be memorable.</p>

<h3 id="slides-are-for-words-the-more-the-better">7. Slides are for Words, the More the Better</h3>

<p>Lifting whole paragraphs and sections from your PhD thesis is an excellent idea especially if it’s a screenshot not text, so later if the audience gets a hold of your slides they can’t copy the text. The goal here is to test the audience’s ability to focus on listening to you and reading the content of the slide at the same time, especially if they don’t match. Make sure to include couple of URLs that has at least two hyphens and one tilde. No URLs shorteners. Don’t forget to refer to the URLs as “important”.</p>

<h3 id="the-crowd-loves-your-messy-desktop">8. The Crowd Loves Your Messy Desktop</h3>

<p>Make sure to minimize all your applications to show your desktop with a stretched picture of your kid riding a dog on a snowmobile which you took last August. Let them try to guess what is this picture by making it difficult to see behind all the icons you have on your desktop including “Yahoo Messenger” and the folder titled “My uncle’s second weddings photos”. Also, remember to leave your Skype on during the session because you don’t want to miss any important messages.</p>

<h3 id="technical-sessions-are-a-test-of-the-crowds-endurance">9. Technical Sessions are a Test of the Crowd’s Endurance</h3>

<p>So, the longer the session, the better. A continuous hour that goes on and on and on is good enough, but if you can sneak in few minutes at the end to finish the last 15 slides, that’s okay too.</p>

<h3 id="answering-questions-is-a-private-discussion">10. Answering Questions is a Private Discussion</h3>

<p>When a person asks a question, try to answer it in the most private manner possible. Ignore that the person’s voice was too low that no one other than you heard it. Get geeky and make references to acronyms that no one understands. Just make sure that the person who asked the question barely understands the answer, and no one else even understood the question.</p>

<p>These are few tips on how to make your technical session the worst ever. I excel at only few of these, but working on some of the others. I wish you all the luck and look forward to your crappy presentation soon.</p>

<p>Everybody loves command centers. We all would love to be Capitan Kirk, setting there seeing information coming in from all over the place, and we can act on it without having to do much work.</p>

<p>The problem with building command centers is that they represent a big unnecessary load on the servers. Command centers now are not like the Star Trek command centers. No, they’re hundreds of users connected to your service, each trying to command their own one decision which in aggregate with hundreds of other users form the output of the system.</p>

<p>These hundreds of computers calling the server every few seconds checking if there’s an update or not represent a big unnecessary load on the server. What I prefer is to call the server when I know that there’s an update, or better, have the server call me, the client, when there’s an update.</p>

<p><em>That’s where SignalR comes in.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://signalr.net/">SignalR</a> is an open source library that let’s you build front-end real-time applications using JavaScript (or .NET). On the back-end you’ll use .NET.</p>

<p>SignalR was a side project started by two guys; <a href="https://twitter.com/davidfowl">David Fowler</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DamianEdwards">Damian Edwards</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR">source code</a> is hosted on GitHub. The project got so much support that <a href="http://www.asp.net/signalr/open-source">Microsoft is now supporting</a> it as part of its ASP.NET family even while maintaining it’s status as an open source project developed in the open.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/352/making-open-source-work-at-microsoft-with-signalr-and-damian-edwards">Listen</a> to Damian Edwards interviewed by Scott Hanselman about SignalR.<br />
<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Building-Web-Apps-with-ASP-NET-Jump-Start/Building-Web-Apps-with-ASPNET-Jump-Start-08-Real-time-Communication-with-SignalR">Watch</a> Damian Edwards and Scott Hanselman demo how to use SignalR.</p>

<p>SignalR makes it incredibly simple to add real-time functionality to your application.</p>

<p>It’s simple because it provides you with a way to just call a function on the client-side. Just RPC a function on the client-side.</p>

<p>It’s simple because your code will work – without you having to change it – with a number of different technologies under the hood.</p>

<p>It starts with WebSockets, and falls back to other technologies if it’s not available.</p>

<p>There are two examples for SignalR you can check out right now: <a href="http://jabbr.net/">Jabbr</a> which is a chat room service. And <a href="http://shootr.signalr.net/">ShootR</a>; a space craft shooter game built with HTML5.</p>

<p>SignalR is split into a .NET component on the server side, and a JavaScript component on the client side. Basically, you create a class that inherits from a Hub class and whatever public method you create is now callable from the client side.</p>

<p>The important thing is that you can define client side functions that are also callable from the server side.</p>

<p>We can use this to add real-time capability to an ArcGIS JavaScript API application. Using a <a href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/jssamples/graphics_add.html">sample from the documentation</a>, I’ve added the real-time capability using a C# class and few modifications to the client side JavaScript.</p>

<p>Here’s a video for how the final proof-of-concept looks like:</p>

<figure class="BetterTube" data-youtube-id="kY3AQL6n2-8" data-player-width="560" data-player-height="315" id="kY3AQL6n2-8" style="padding-bottom: 56.25%"><a class="BetterTubePlayer" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_426RiwST8" style="background: url(http://img.youtube.com/vi/kY3AQL6n2-8/hqdefault.jpg) 50% 50% no-repeat rgb(0, 0, 0);"></a><div class="BetterTube-playBtn"></div>&nbsp;</figure>

<p>The code is all up on <a href="https://github.com/AmrEldib/RealTimeGisWithSignalR">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I was invited to speak at Esri DevSummit 2013 on March 28, 2013. Here are the <a href="/public/images/RealTimeGis/Real-Time GIS Using SignalR and Esri's JavaScript API.pdf">slides for my talk</a>. They provide few more details. </p>

<p>There’s a few book on SignalR out now, you can get <a href="http://www.campusmvp.net/signalr-ebook/">here</a>. </p>
