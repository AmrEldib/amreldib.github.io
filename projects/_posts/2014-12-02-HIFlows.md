<a href="http://hellointernet.fm/" target="_blank">Hello Internet</a> is a two-dudes-talking podcast by <a href="http://www.cgpgrey.com/" target="_blank">CGP Grey</a> and <a href="http://www.bradyharan.com/" target="_blank">Brady Haran</a>.  
<a href="http://www.amreldib.com/HIFlows/" target="_blank">HI Flows</a> is a fan-made project charting the flow of discussion of each episode. It's based on the charts made by fans on the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/CGPGrey/" target="_blank">Hello Internet Reddit page</a>.  
For every episode of the show, there's a flow chart mapping out the conversion between Brady and Grey with all the silly details. The audio is linked to the chart, you can jump to the part of the conversaion by clicking on any step. Links and images are added to keep things fun. Check out the [Christmas special](http://www.amreldib.com/HIFlows/27/).
