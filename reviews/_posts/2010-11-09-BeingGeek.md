Being Geek is an interesting read. Michael Lopp is able to capture that thought in your head and articulate it on paper. But that only works so many times.  
Some of the chapters in this book are so good and so matching my experience that I wrote some notes on the side while reading the book. Other chapters, I don't even know what he's talking about.  
Most chapters revolve around their title. The author sums up a certain situation - which is the center of this chapter - in the chapter title. To explain the title, the author explains the situation and then sum it up with the title and keeps referring to the title and if you fail to 'get' what the title is and what the situation is, the rest of the chapter becomes very boring. So you get something like the 'Holy Shit Moment' which I still not sure what it is despite the fact that it's a common phrase I very well understand.  
If you liked 'Managing Humans' (Lopp's first book) or you like this genre of books about the software development process in a non-technical way, you'll find this book interesting.
