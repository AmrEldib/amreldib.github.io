Inside Out is pretty clever. It doesn't give up on the complixity of the issue, but offers it in a simple way. It embraces all of our emtions and doesn't deny any of them, aiming for reaching a balance.  
It highlights how emtions, that are usually deemed negative (e.g. sadness), are part of who we are and can serve us well if we let it do its part.  
It's amazing how this complixity is offered in what is considered a kids animation movie. This is what movies should be like; doesn't scarifice the story for entraining the audenince.
