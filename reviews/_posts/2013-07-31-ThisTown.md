If you always hated Washington, now you have a detailed explanation for "Why?".  
This book is a collection of stories witnessed by the author (a long time Washington reporter) who not only knows these stories first hand but actually participated in some of them.  
The book's tone is funny but aware that it's about a very serious topic. It comes off as "sad to be laughing about this".  
The book can feed the cynicism about Washington, but mostly it's the acts of the characters in the book that are feeding that cynicism.  
There's no grand conclusion or "Here's my 37-point plan for how to fix Washington". It's mostly like "I've lived there and knew these people and thought you should know this".  
It's an excellent read, and I recommend it.
