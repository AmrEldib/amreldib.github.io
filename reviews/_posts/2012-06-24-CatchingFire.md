I'm not thrilled with this book.  

<span class="spoiler-tag">It felt like it's written to please readers with unexpected twists (that are totally expected if you watch enough movies or read enough novels) and love triangles (built out of thin air) extended to keep readers hooked. Story still doesn't offer any ideas behind the mere progress of events. No deep exploration of characters, war, society, nothing. It's just a confused young girl being confused. She has amazing abilities when it fits, and is young and innocent when it fits.</span>  

Maybe I'm just not a good reader of fiction or the book is too long to enjoy it like a movie (2 hours with complete focus), or maybe this book is just over-hyped.
