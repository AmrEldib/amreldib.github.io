Solid action movie.  
People tend to dismiss Tom Cruise but in the past two years, he delivered two solid actions movies; Mission Impossible and Edge of Tomorrow.  
<span class="spoiler-tag">I really like how the movie has a strong female lead who is as much an equal to Cruise as any other. To make things even better, the movie avoids any BS romantic subplot between the two leads which these type of movie usually have. Instead, they have a deeper unspoken bond of two people who understand what it's like to be the other.<br/>
    The movie is, of couse, a mission impossible movie with the usual MI tricks which is expected. However, I really like how every time they seem to have locked themselves in a corner, they got out of it in a reasonable manner. It made sense in the movie-logic.</span>
