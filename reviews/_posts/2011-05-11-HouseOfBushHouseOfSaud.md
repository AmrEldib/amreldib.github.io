Normally, I try to find something in the book that makes it not eligible for a 5 stars rating because nothing is perfect. Most of the time there's is something in the book that takes away that 5th star. This book is not one of those.  
It's full of information, told in a way that keeps you anticipating as if it's a drama, and most importantly all these information and story lines are backed by references to sources including books, congressional records, declassified memos and reports.  
It might be a little difficult for someone who have no prior knowledge on the topic to keep up with all the characters and the names. It's especially difficult because most names are in Arabic and English and if you don't know one of the two languages, then half of the names are difficult to keep up with. However that is a minor issue comparing to the amount of information provided in the book.  
This book is totally worth reading (or listening to the Audio book like I did).
