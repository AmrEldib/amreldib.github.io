One word: Fantastic.  
I can draw a Venn diagram to describe this book. It would be three awesome circles: True Story, Told like a dramatic story, About Games. This book is at the intersection of these three circles. I can enjoy the story with all its drama, I can learn about all that happened, and I can have a wide smile when I remember all my childhood days playing those games.  
If you played any of these games as a kid: Wolf 3D, Doom, or Quake, read this book.
