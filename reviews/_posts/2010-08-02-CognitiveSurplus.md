Clay Shirky's ability to witness changes in our lives due to the Internet and social media, and support that with stories from all over the world is still great.  
Building on what he started in "Here Comes Everybody", Shirky breaks down social media into main components: Means, Motive, Opportunity and Culture.  
The book is full of stories from all over the world about the effects of social media on people's lives and they're told in a way that makes it interesting even if you're not interested in the topic of the book.  
The book doesn't come to a verdict on social media, it's still a running process that is just starting.  
The book slows down sometimes and gets a little repetitive, but it's still a great read.
