Not as good as America the Book. Not great as an Audiobook. Hard cover version is much better.  
America the book was more of a single story with some related stories around it. This is more of a collection of stories bound together with one story.  
I liked that it made some serious points on few occasions.  
Not for children at all. Way too many sexual references.  
The stuff about religion is just not funny.  
Still thinks The Daily Show is great.
