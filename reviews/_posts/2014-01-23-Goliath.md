Very detailed, excellent reporting, and very depressing.  
This book is a true eye opener. It's not as if my eyes were shut to Israel's actions against Palestinians, I knew about that. But Israel's actions against its citizens, whether they're Arabs, Africans, Russian, or of any other race or background were shocking.  
While the book was truly depressing sometimes, just because of the sad state of humanity, this book is really a must-read for any defender or opposer of Israel.
