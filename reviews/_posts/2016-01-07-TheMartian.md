Matt Damon is stuck on Mars. NASA wants to save him. <span class="spoiler-tag">They do.</span>
<p class="spoiler-tag">The movie seems to have forgot to have an inspiring message of hope and hanging in there during the movie, so they added a scene at the very end to do just that. It's a good scene, but it's only one.</p>
<p class="spoiler-tag">The movie has this subplot about how NASA worries about its public image, which is understandable. I'm sure every organization considers that in their decisions. However, this subplot have very little consequences, and doesn't really make much sense.</p>
<p class="spoiler-tag">The movie's message is very simple: YAY Science!</p>
Watch it on TV. Or, maybe read the book, everyone says it's good.
