A look behind the scene during the last days of Mubarak's 30 years of rule over Egypt. It's a good story, and the author does a good job reporting. However, it seems to have be put together in a hurry, I found two obvious errors in the book. The author was quick to correct them after my email to him. It's an ebook release, so the author can make changes easily. Good read.
