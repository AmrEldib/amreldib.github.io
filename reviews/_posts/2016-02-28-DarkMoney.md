Absolutely scary  
It's no secret that the Koch Brothers spend a lot of money to influence elections, any observer of US politics knows this. But learning about the extent and scope of their operation is another thing. It amounts to money-laundering for the purpose of influencing politics.  
It's not just the amount of money being spent, but the scope of their goals, the size of their operation, and how much ROI they're getting so far.  
If you're interested in understanding today's US politics, this book is an essential read.
