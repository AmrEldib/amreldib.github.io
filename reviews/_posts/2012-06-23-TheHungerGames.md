I'm not much of a fiction reader. I prefer movies. Easier and much more time efficient. Go ahead, disagree with that.  
I watched the movie first. Hated the first half hour, and got really excited during the rest of the movie. Got really intrigued at the end and couldn't wait to know what happens next. So, here I am.  
The novel definitely offers more than the movie. It gives more back story, and details where the movie offers quick scenes.  
I can't really comment on the story unless I know how it plays out. Not necessarily how it ends, but what's the idea behind the story, what it's trying to say. This part I still don't get after the first part.  
It was easy to read the first part, because I watched the movie. Characters had faces of actors.  
I look forward to the second and third books.
