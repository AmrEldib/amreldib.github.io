We tend to dismiss North Korea and even consider their threats of destroying the world to be 'so adorable'. Fun aside, it's a case for what happens when you keep an entire country is captivity, isolated from the world for some many years.  
I have no doubt that lots of people in North Korea actually believe their government. They're totally isolated from the world. I look at some people, even ones I personally know, in Egypt and they believe what the government says. They're much more connected to the world, but don't underestimate the government's ability to manipulate their own people.
