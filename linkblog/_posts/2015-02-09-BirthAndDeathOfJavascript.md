<p>
    Great talk by Gary Bernhardt about how Javascript will be the assembly language of all applications, not web applications, but all. <br />
    This reminds me of a blog post by Scott Hanselman about <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/JavaScriptIsAssemblyLanguageForTheWebSematicMarkupIsDeadCleanVsMachinecodedHTML.aspx" target="_blank">Javascript becoming the Assembly Language for the Web</a> (and <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/JavaScriptisAssemblyLanguagefortheWebPart2MadnessorjustInsanity.aspx" target="_blank">follow up blog with reactions from Javascript gurus</a>).<br/>
    Hanselman's point was about how all Javascript is machine-generated and not directly written by developers. Bernhardt's talk is the next step to that; how we can take existing languages and compile them to Javascript to run those applications in the browser. Then, use the isolation model of the browser to achive better process isolation and remove overhead.<br/>
    These are not predications. <a href="http://asmjs.org/" target="_blank">ASM.js</a> is a Mozilla project to enable running C/C++ (and other) languages in the browser at near native speed.
