title: "Trump is the GOP’s Frankenstein monster. Now he’s strong enough to destroy the party"
excerpt: "Was it not the party’s wild obstructionism — the repeated threats to shut down the government over policy and legislative disagreements, the persistent calls for nullification of Supreme Court decisions, the insistence that compromise was betrayal, the internal coups against party leaders who refused to join the general demolition — that taught Republican voters that government, institutions, political traditions, party leadership and even parties themselves were things to be overthrown, evaded, ignored, insulted, laughed at?"

It's obvious to some that Trump's rise is the logical conclusion of a long decades of insanity by the Republican party in the name of winning elections, starting with the Southern strategy of Nixon, up to George W. Bush's compassionate conservatism.  
But this article is not by outsider, but rather a *leading neoconservative* which makes the declarations of the article much stronger.  
If The Donald wins the primaries, which seems more likely everyday, the GOP might be heading to a huge loss in November. I hoping it's the kind that leads to some soul-searching.  

> Let’s be clear: Trump is no fluke. Nor is he hijacking the Republican Party or the conservative movement, if there is such a thing. He is, rather, the party’s creation, its Frankenstein’s monster, brought to life by the party, fed by the party and now made strong enough to destroy its maker.

> Then there was the party’s accommodation to and exploitation of the bigotry in its ranks. No, the majority of Republicans are not bigots. But they have certainly been enablers.

> Then there was the Obama hatred, a racially tinged derangement syndrome that made any charge plausible and any opposition justified.
> Thus Obama is not only wrong but also anti-American, un-American, non-American

> We are supposed to believe that Trump’s legion of “angry” people are angry about wage stagnation. No, they are angry about all the things Republicans have told them to be angry about these past 7 years

> So what to do now? The Republicans’ creation will soon be let loose on the land, leaving to others the job the party failed to carry out. For this former Republican, and perhaps for others, the only choice will be to vote for Hillary Clinton. The party cannot be saved, but the country still can be.
