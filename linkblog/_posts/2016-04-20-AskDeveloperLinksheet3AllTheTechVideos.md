Hey everybody,<br>
<br>
I'm just gonna casually start as if I haven't been away for a while. It's conference season (as you'll see in a bit), and after going to conferences, you gotta take a short vacation. But you shouldn't really take unlimited vacation, as some startups pride themselves on offering. Phill Haack of GitHub <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2016/02/18/unlimited-vaction-pitfalls/">explains</a>. He highlights <a href="http://www.paperplanes.de/2014/12/10/from-open-to-minimum-vacation-policy.html">TravisCI vacation policy</a> as a good example of what a company should do; minimum vacation, rather than unlimited vacation.<br>
<br>
Boston Dynamics showcased their newest addition; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVlhMGQgDkY">Atlas</a>, to the company's lineup of future destroyers of humanity. I'm hoping the company will get exposed as a fraud or a big joke and none of these robots are actually autonomous. This is less terrifying than watching that guy at the end poking the robot with a hockey stick. DON'T MAKE IT ANGRY.<br>
<br>
Continuing with our theme of robots acquiring the abilities to kill us all. Google showed their <a href="https://twitter.com/arashmil/status/701705428074418176">image analyzer</a>, and Microsoft now has a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/computer-vision-api">Vision API</a>. Computers can identify items in images fairly well.<br>
<br>
Elon Musk remains our biggest hope to fight the coming robot age. He does this by inventing more amazing machines. A <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/04/how-to-land-a-rocket-on-a-robotic-barge/">25-floors high rocket that lands on a boat</a>, and an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/04/teslas-model-3-is-herethese-are-the-details-youve-been-waiting-for/">affordable electric car</a>.<br>
<br>
While I await this epic battle, I'm watching lots of tech videos. It's conference season. So, watch all of <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016">Microsoft's BUILD</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMmzJ82sCmooDdtzVY8FxEA/videos?sort=dd&view=0&shelf_id=0">EmberConf</a>, and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/videos">Facebook's F8</a><br>
<br>
Tom Dale and Yehuda Katz's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xbN67jA4YA">EmberConf keynote</a> shows Ember growth and demos improvements made possible by Glimmer 2 and FastBoot, as well as points the way forward for Ember.<br>
<br>
BUILD covered many topics, but I've noticed <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B891">the future of .NET</a> and <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/B810" target="_blank">ASP.NET Core 1.0</a> among other things.<br>
<br>
Another conference, virtual, is <a href="https://www.crowdcast.io/e/hacksummit-2016">Hack.Summit()</a> which featured lots of speakers, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hEtQ70scho">Joel Spolsky talking about how to have nice things</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL5ygTDh1uE">Yehuda Katz explaining why you probably want to use a framework</a>.<br>
<br>
But conference videos lead to other conference videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFRU6eQKp4Y">The Social Coding Contract</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0xpKsKb2Bk">Immutability, Interactivity & JavaScript</a>. Not as recent, but just as good.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping the next link sheet won't take as long, but I think I'll switch from targeting regular intervals to "when it's ready" type of goal.<br>
