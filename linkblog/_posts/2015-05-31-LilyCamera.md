This is autonomous flying camera is only $500. Only 10 years ago, to shoot this kind of video you needed a professional film crew, pilot and a helicopter. This would've cost a lot more than $500/hour. Not to mention you get to own the camera, not to mention the camera is a lot more flexable and smaller than the helicopter, not to mention that you need no coordination between the pilot and the cameraman. Not to mention the quality on this camera is better than most professional cameras 10 years ago.  
This kind of cameras is an incredible leap of technology, and is a sign of things to come.
