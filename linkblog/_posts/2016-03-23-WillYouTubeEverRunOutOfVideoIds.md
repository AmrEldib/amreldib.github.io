I'm not sure what is it I like more about this video. The content, how it's explained very well, the long one take, the great camera work, the nice view in the background, or how Tom Scott does the entire thing from memory. It's just incredible.  
Worth watching, multiple times. When you're done, watch this [other video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dyy41yAs8nc) where they talk about shooting this video and the camera equipment.
