<blockquote>
Things went south In 2012, when Ivanovic launched a new version of the Pocket Casts app on the Android Play Store first, rather than Apple's App Store. The launch was a real success, and he publicly shared the good news. Before he knew it, his Apple Developer Relations representative stopped all contact. The representative would not even answer his emails. Ivanovic had been completely shut out.

Great read on the state of App Store developers and the fear of criticizing Apple.<br/>
It's Part 4 of a series but it stands on its own as well.
