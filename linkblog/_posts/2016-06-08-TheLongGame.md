excerpt: "Don't learn from the lucky ones, learn from the losers"
---

We have an obsession with those who succeed young, it's a rather unhealthy one. There's no doubt that those who succeed have the talent for it, and that's worth admiring, but it's probably luck that made succeed _at such a young age_. It's those who's success comes later in life who are really worth admiring. There are lots of people who are really talented, and deserve success but never get it because they give up on trying after repeated failures. Now, it seems that there's more pressure to give up earlier and earlier because _if you haven't made it by now, you'll never make it_. This is totally wrong, and this video series makes the point better than I can.
