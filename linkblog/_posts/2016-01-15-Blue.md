This is a picture I took of an actual painting in [Centre Georges Pompidou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Georges_Pompidou) in Paris. It's a single shade of blue on a rectangle canvas.  
It's not any shade of blue, as it turns out, it's IKB (International Klein Blue), and the painting is made by [Yves Klein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Klein).  
If I say more, I'll just explain it badly. Watch the video. It's very interesting.  
How can I get you to do that?  
Oh, right, there's a full length movie of entirely the same color.
