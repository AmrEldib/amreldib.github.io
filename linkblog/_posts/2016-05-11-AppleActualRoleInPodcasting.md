title: "Apple's actual role in podcasting: be careful what you wish for"
excerpt: "Marco Arment explains why Apple having a bigger role in podcasting is a bad idea"
---

Marco Arment, a [podcaster](http://atp.fm/) and a developer of a [podcasting iOS app](https://overcast.fm/), explains why Apple having a bigger role in podcasting is a bad idea. A recent New York Times article almost urges Apple to get into podcasting beyond having an index. It asks for a role like YouTube have for Video. Marco's post explains why this is a terrible idea, and why podcasting is working well without a big player.  
I couldn't agree more.
