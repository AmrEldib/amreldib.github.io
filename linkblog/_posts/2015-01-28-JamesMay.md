<blockquote>
    'May confessed that in 1992 he was dismissed from Autocar magazine after putting together a hidden message or acrostic in one issue.'<br />
    'May's role was to put the entire supplement together, which was extremely boring and took several months'.<br />
    'May's original message, punctuated appropriately, reads: So you think it's really good, yeah? You should try making the bloody thing up; it's a real pain in the arse.'.<br />
    'The editors of Autocar missed the 'joke' and only became aware of it when readers started calling in about it, thinking there might be a prize. '
