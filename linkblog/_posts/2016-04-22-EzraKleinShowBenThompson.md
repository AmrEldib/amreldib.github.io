I've been following Ben Thompson for a while since his recent appearances on [Twit](https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech). He has some really good insights about tech companies, not as producers of tech, but as companies.  
His last apprearance on the [Ezra Klein show](http://www.vox.com/ezra-klein-show-podcast) is really worth a listen. They discuss tech, silicon vally, digital media, his time at Apple and Microsoft, politics, and living in Taiwan.  
The [show notes](http://www.vox.com/technology/2016/4/21/11464604/ben-thompson-ezra-klein-show) capture the list of topics.
