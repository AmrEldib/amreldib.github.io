<p>Firefox Sync syncs your browser profile (bookmarks, history, tabs, etc) across multiple devices (desktop and Android). Use this addon to send a tab from one desktop to another or to Android. This functionality is built into Android but an addon is required on Desktop. I use this all the time when I come across something at work or on the go but would rather look at when I'm home.</p>
