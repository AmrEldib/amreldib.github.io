# TL:DR - The Anti-Clickbait

A lot of articles, blog posts, and websites now rely on clickbait titles. The content under those titles is usually empty and has nothing to do with the title. I totally hate that. A lot of people do too.  
There doesn't seem to be a good answer to clickbait websites. One twitter account tries to solve that: SavedYouAClick.  
Maybe bloggers can counter the clickbait websites by offering the anti-clickbait. It's already something some, if not a lot of, people use: TL:DR.  
But instead of just offering a paragraph, we can add a bit of technology to it. Wrap that paragraph with a custom HTML5 data tag that indicate that this is the TL:DR paragraph.  
Then crawlars (and other web services) can read that paragraph and pass it to the user who can decide if this is the article is worth their time or not.  
Guidelines for writing TL:DRs can include:  

- Don't write "My thoughts on xxxx". This is no substitue for reading. Write: "I think xxxxx is terrible". Now, I want to read this post because I want to know the reasons. But if I don't read the post, at least I know that you think it's terrible. If I read enough summaries like this one, I'll know that a lot of people think this thing is terrible instead of knowing that a lot of people have thoughts on that topic.
