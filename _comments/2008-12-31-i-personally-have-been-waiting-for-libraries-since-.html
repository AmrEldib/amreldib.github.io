I personally have been waiting for Libraries since the early Longhorn WinFS days.<BR/><BR/>I can see your point on the issue with two files with the same name. <BR/><BR/>But there's ways of sorting that...<BR/><BR/>For example if you have thumbnails view on you would be able to see a preview of the file in most cases.<BR/>Or you could use, Group by - Location, so you would then be able to see that test.txt is in Documents (personal docs folder) as well as Public Documents.<BR/><BR/><BR/>I'm personally going to find Libraries very useful as I have 7Tbs worth of data.<BR/><BR/>I have Music and Picture and Movie folders spread across multiple drives and network shares.<BR/>With the Music Library for example, I am then able to add the locations for all my mp3s and then arrange them with the Stack Views - Artists, Album and Genre etc.<BR/>The stacks views in combination with the Libraries will be a great way of viewing and sorting files from multiple locations virtually, without actually effecting the real file location. And then filtering through them further with the stacks.<BR/>On the same note, I can then still browse these music folders through their physical locations, as I don’t always want to see my parent’s music, or music from the last lan party.<BR/><BR/>However, there's two things I wish Microsoft improved upon.<BR/><BR/>First are the stack views themselves,<BR/>Libraries are most useful based on these views, so it’s a shame they didn't create a more powerful file browser with 3D views e.g. Phodeo using WPF. It would also be nice if the size of the icons for the stacks themselves were dynamically generated based on how many items are in it.<BR/><BR/>Then we have Lists.<BR/>This was a feature that was briefly in Vista pre beta 1.<BR/>This is basically your "Burn Folder" on OSX.<BR/>This is a virtual folder that simply allows you to create a static list of files from any location. This is most useful when you want to burn/copy files but you don't want to have to move or create duplicate files. Hence the name Burn Folder on OSX.<BR/><BR/>So they are actually just shortcuts to the real files. However, they behave as if the real file. E.g. if you copy or burn it, it’s going to copy/burn the actual file and not the shortcut.<BR/><BR/>The sooner Microsoft moves people away from Folders and more into the virtual folder structures the better. It might be confusing for the average folk at first, but in the long run, it’s the smarter move.
