LOL, I liked that part :-)<br />Of course, they call it “Marketplace” because if they call it App Store, we might think it’s the exact same thing as Apple’<br /><br />The issue as you mention on the EndOf your article, its money money money :-), and the proof is, they just released those guidelines lately as you just mention, if that wa their main objective, they would do that before openning the App Store :)<br /><br />Thanks for your effort making that great post.
