<p>A year ago, <a href="http://www.amreldib.com/2009/01/cubicexplorer-arabic-translation-is.html" target="_blank">I released</a> an Arabic translation for my favorite alternative of Windows Explorer, Cubic Explorer. After a year of updates of the software, I thought the translation might need some updating and I also noticed some mistakes that needed to be fixed.</p>  <p>Now you can get an updated release of the translation (release 1.1). You can find it at my public SkyDrive <a href="http://bit.ly/6sTDe1" target="_blank">here</a>. This translation works with Cubic Explorer release 0.91.0.1223 (SVN Snapshot) which you can get <a href="http://www.cubicreality.com/2010/01/15/notes-week-2-polished-info-bar-and-ces-future/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>  <p>Hopefully the updated translation will be included in the installer very soon.</p>  <p>Enjoy.</p>
