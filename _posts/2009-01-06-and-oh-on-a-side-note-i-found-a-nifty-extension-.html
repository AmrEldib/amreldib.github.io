and oh,  on a side note I found a nifty extension to make Firefox take much less memory when having multiple tabs open.<BR/><BR/>It turns out that Flash content on websites can consume quite a lot of memory, and rarely give it back once you close the tab.<BR/><BR/>the Flash Block extension is wonderful in stopping flash content to be loaded and (if you have javascript enabled) allows you to easily enable each induvidual flash content you wish to use/see (for example youtube videos)<BR/><BR/>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/433
