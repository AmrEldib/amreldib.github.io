Google would literally get tens of thousands of feature requests if they had a feedback form, so they just don't. They wouldn't have time to look through them all without spending more on staff (which no one wants to do in this climate).<BR/><BR/>The way Google has always improved its services is by listening to what the internet in general thinks. If a lot of people were asking for the same feature as you in their blogs, on forums, and other places, then I'm sure they'd include it.
