<p>Ever wondered how firefox is still running even though all of Mozilla's products are for free..</p>  <p>First, it must be denotations, the "Best Browser Implementing Web Standards" - according to Mozilla - must be receiving lots of denotations from its wide user base. But There are actually two Mozillas, the Foundation and the Corporation.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation">Foundation</a> is a non-profit organization that handles the leadership for the open source Mozilla project, the polices, key infrastructure, trademarks and that stuff. Its revenue is tax-exempt status under the U.S. tax code as it's based in Mountain View, California.</p>  <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation">Corporation</a> is a subsidiary of the foundation that coordinates the development of internet-related applications such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox">firefox</a>. It also depends on denotations but there's also a deal with Google that whenever a user uses that little search box on the top right and he/she clicks an ad in the search results offered by Google, Mozilla gets 80% of the revenue. That little box is <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2006/03/06/firefox-mozilla-corporation-mozilla-foundation-made-72m-last/">rumored</a> to had made $72M last year. It's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation">confirmed</a> (by Wikipedia, read the Financing section) that $61.5M were Mozilla's revenues in 2006 because of the little box out of a total $66.8M of revenues.</p>  <p>It's good to see Mozilla going strong financially as they are technically. Looks like the red fox is gonna be sticking around for a while.. bad news for the guys in Redmond..</p>
