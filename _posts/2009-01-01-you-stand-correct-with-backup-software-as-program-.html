You stand correct with backup software, as programs will need to be updated to understand a library.<BR/><BR/>As in regards to users saving stuff, are you aware that there are default locations hardwired to each library?<BR/><BR/>So if a user goes to save a Word Document and clicks on the Documents link in the Save dialog box, which as we know is the documents library, it will still actually redirect the file save and place the document inside the Users Personal Documents Folder.<BR/><BR/>Microsoft should really make the public very aware of this feature and how it works.<BR/><BR/>Once the general public understand it, it will be for the better.<BR/><BR/>Again as I said in my first post, if Explorer had some really "WOW" views and effects on different ways to arranging the files within libraries it would help show off how useful they are.<BR/>I feel that Windows 7 is still only half of what the original Longhorn vision was. Hereâ€™s to Windows 8 sigh...
