My <a href="http://amreldib.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">personal blog</a> where I write mostly in my native Arabic is hosted on Tumblr which is a nice platform but is really bad in supporting Arabic and other RTL languages. At least that’s my experience. </div><p align="justify"> So finally I got sick of it and decided that I’m gonna fix this with some HTML and CSS magic. Maybe with <a href="http://rtl-this.com/tutorial/how-rtl-your-tumblr-theme" target="_blank">some help</a>. I did find that Tumblr has some nice features that helps fixing the problem. Let’s see how. </p><p align="justify">Tumblr lets you modify the HTML and insert additional CSS to your page. You gotta be careful when you’re doing this. At least make a backup of your page before you try new changes. </p><p align="justify">One nice feature is that you can add <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes" target="_blank">{TagsAsClasses}</a> as a CSS class. This will allow Tumblr to read the tags you attach to your post and apply them as a CSS class. I’ll use this as a way of marking the Arabic posts that I’d like to display from Right-to-Left. For every one of these posts, I’ll add the tag “arabic” and then Tumblr will apply the CSS class to that post. </p><p align="justify">I’ve used a simple theme named <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/theme/9601" target="_blank">Quite Big</a> as my base theme. You’ll find a DIV with the classes “content” and “<i>x</i>-post”. x-post is not the name of a class but rather text-post, photo-post, quote-post, and link-post. One class for each type of post. </p><br/><p align="center"><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-nlsTcDzTCao/UYWfkcvS2lI/AAAAAAAAAV4/tkrEX8dpXWs/s1600-h/TumblrPostsTypes%25255B6%25255D.png"><img alt="Types of Tumblr Posts" border="0" height="108" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-eQ2Mz9db_ZE/UYWfkqpUZOI/AAAAAAAAAWA/cVxnH9QQ1qo/TumblrPostsTypes_thumb%25255B4%25255D.png?imgmax=800" style="background-image: none; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px;" title="Types of Tumblr Posts" width="563" /></a></p><br/><p align="justify">You’ll need to find each one of these DIVs and add “{TagsAsClasses}” to its CSS classes. </p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/5519226.js"></script></p><h3> Wait, where can I get the HTML? </h3><p align="justify">In the <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/settings" target="_blank">Settings</a> section, click on the item at the bottom of the list on the left where you should see your avatar. Next to “Theme”, click “Customize”.<br />On the left, you’ll find “Edit HTML”. </p><p align="justify">After you save the modified HTML. While in the “Customize” mode, scroll down to the bottom in the pane on the left. You’ll find a “Add Custom CSS” section. This is where we’ll add a definition of how we want to display the Arabic posts. </p><p align="justify">{TagsAsClasses} allows us to add a tag to any post and apply it as a CSS class. The name of the CSS class must match the name of the tag. In my case, I chose “arabic”. Here’s the CSS I used. </p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/5519240.js"></script></p><p align="justify">This will apply the RTL direction, it will align the text to the right, and make the font size a little bit bigger. </p><h3> How to Use Web Fonts? </h3><p align="justify">Now that I went through the posts and added the “arabic” tag and everything is right to left. I need a good font to really make the blog look beautiful. Nothing pleases me when I’m writing Arabic like the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/amiri/" target="_blank">Amiri font</a>. Since it’s available on <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/earlyaccess" target="_blank">Google Web Fonts</a>, this makes my task much easier. </p><p align="justify">First, I import Amiri.css. I go back to the HTML of my pages. Before the very end of the <b><i>&lt;style&gt;</i></b> element in the <b><i>&lt;head&gt;</i></b> (search for <b><i>&lt;/style&gt;</i></b> and place the next line right before it): </p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/5519244.js"></script></p><p align="justify">Then I got back to the additional CSS, and slightly modify the CSS to look like this: </p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/5519246.js"></script></p><h3> What about the Headers? </h3><p align="justify">I notice the headers need a little bit of a change. They don’t have the right font. So, I go back to the HTML, and find the H3 element for the titles, and change it to look like this: </p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/5519249.js"></script></p><p align="justify">Then modify the CSS to look like this: </p><p><script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/5519196.js"></script></p><p align="justify">Now, the headers and the body are using Amiri and the header has the right size. </p><p align="justify">I’ve published the <a href="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/5519192" target="_blank">modified HTML file</a> on a GitHub gist if you want to use the same theme. Here is the <a href="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/5519196" target="_blank">additional CSS</a>. </p>
