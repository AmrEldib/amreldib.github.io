<p><b>TL;DR</b> Follow <a href="#steps">these steps</a> to add a bookmark to your browser that opens YouTube videos in a popup window. <br /></p><p>Aside from my laptop, I use two monitors. This allows my to "multitask" which is fancy talk for having something running/playing in the background while I'm actually working.<br />Sometimes the thing that is running in the background is a YouTube video. This is great with music videos and long videos that don't need my full attention. However, I find it annoying to have the YouTube page or video fill the entire screen. What I need is a small window with just the video. I don't really need the comments, suggestions, header, etc.</p><p>The embed HTML is the key here. You can right-click on the video and directly copy the embed code. It looks like this:</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q-RmwLQsRXE/UncJeavtYZI/AAAAAAAAAlQ/tuju9TuYOms/s1600/CopyYouTubeEmbedCode.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q-RmwLQsRXE/UncJeavtYZI/AAAAAAAAAlQ/tuju9TuYOms/s1600/CopyYouTubeEmbedCode.png" /></a></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/7297359.js"></script><p>Embed code has a lot of options that you can view in the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en#171780" target="_blank">help section</a>.<br />This embed code is of an iFrame that opens a YouTube page at a certain URL. YouTube would actually take care of removing all of the extra stuff that I don't need.<br />Browser bookmarks can run a JavaScript function which would open a popup window of a YouTube page with just this video.<br /></p><script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/7297410.js"></script><p>The JavaScript function looks at the active browser tab and picks up the unique ID of the video before constructing the embed URL and opening a new browser window with that URL.<br />To avoid a predictable problem, the function will make sure that you're on a YouTube page before it opens the popup window. If not, it will display an error message. </p><h2 id="steps">How to Add This to My Browser</h2><ol><li>Copy this code:</li><script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/7297410.js"></script><li>Open your browser's Bookmark window.</li><li>Create a new bookmark, and give it a name. Say: Popup YouTube Video.</li><li>In the location, paste the code listed above.</li><li>You're all done.</li></ol>
