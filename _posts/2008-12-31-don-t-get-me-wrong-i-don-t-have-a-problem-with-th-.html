Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with the Library concept. My question - like I repeatedly said - is "Why?". If libraries is something that Microsoft thinks is better than folders (especially with folder content spanning over several HDs) then maybe they should introduce it as a concept with sufficient publicity, attention, and research of users feedback because it's something that will affect every user.<BR/><BR/>The "Documents" link now direct to the Documents library rather than the Documents folder under User profile folder. This is something that will affect every user who is using the profile folders. <BR/>Now, are virtual folders (or libraries) recognizable by backup software. I don't think so, probably backup software will have to be modified to recognize those libraries. If I'm an average user who can't notice the difference between the library and the Documents folder that I've been using forever. I'm gonna have some problems.<BR/><BR/>I like Microsoft's attempts to make some changes, I just hope that these changes are meaningful and reflect actual user needs and solve actual problems.
