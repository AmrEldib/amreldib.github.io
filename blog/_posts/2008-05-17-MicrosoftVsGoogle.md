I think it would be fair to say that there seem to be a competition going on between Microsoft and Google. It's ridiculous to deny it since Microsoft is making all of those moves to compete with Google (Enhancing [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/desktopsearch/default.mspx) Search, Ballmer [announcing](http://web-advertising.suite101.com/article.cfm/microsoft_advertising_strategy) that 25% of Microsoft revenues would come from advertising, [acquisition](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/aug07/08-13MSaQuantivePR.mspx) of aQuantive for 6B$, and [offer](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/feb08/02-01CorpNewsPR.mspx) to buy Yahoo! for more than 44B$). Even though the two companies doesn't share much of battlegrounds (search and online advertising, which both represent a fraction of Microsoft revenues), The two companies - especially Microsoft - seem to be more concerned with one another more and more. Why is that?

1. A few years back when Google was on the rise, the question &quot;How can stop Google?&quot; was naturally followed by &quot;Could it be Microsoft?&quot;. The collision of the two powers is a natural course of events, and Microsoft is thinking &quot;let's do it now before Google [gets too big](http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/5/google_to_surpass_size_of_microsoft_windows_in_2009) to handle&quot;.

2. Google expanding its products to provide cheap (free is cheap, right?) only-core-widely-used-features everywhere-accessible alternatives to Microsoft products (for example, Google Docs vs Office) is threatening Microsoft future revenues. It kinda feels like Netscape replacing windows all over again. Microsoft is thinking &quot;It's not about generating more profit, it's a matter of national security&quot;.

3. The business model offered by Google, a company offering free products that makes millions of dollars, is more effective than Microsoft traditional-software-company business model. Microsoft is thinking &quot;Adopt it or beat it, or maybe adopt it and beat everybody else&quot;.

4. Google's products are the closest thing to Microsoft's Software-as-a-Service licensing model that was supposed to replace the traditional license model currently used. Microsoft is probably thinking &quot;Those Google guys stole my idea and they're making money of it, I'll #&amp;jlk%fn&amp;h!i* them&quot;.

5. Online advertising is generating more profit everyday. Microsoft is thinking &quot;Why not get a bigger piece of the pie&quot;.

Well, we've established that there is a fight. But how real is it?

- Microsoft can avoid the [&quot;If Google is winning, then we must be losing&quot;](http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/5/google_to_surpass_size_of_microsoft_windows_in_2009#comment-4829b325796c7a88001709b4) attitude which seem be driving the company lately, like the Microhoo merger that will take at least a year to be active because of all the in-house arrangements that has to happen. Stopping that attitude will make the fight look much less intense.  
- Microsoft should take a moment and re-plan its online strategy, at least to avoid all the redundant services (for example, [Folder Share](https://www.foldershare.com/welcome.aspx), [SkyDrive](http://skydrive.live.com/), and [Live Mesh](https://www.mesh.com/Welcome/Welcome.aspx)). This might give Microsoft's effort in online services a chance to compete with Google in that area.
- Even though online advertising is driving Google's revenues, Google's services is what's threatening Microsoft. And while it's a good strategy to directly compete in online advertising which will dry Google funds for building those services, it's still sufficient to build better services - or software - to limit Google services' affect on Microsoft revenues.

How real is the fight, if someone came out on top.. then, it's real.
