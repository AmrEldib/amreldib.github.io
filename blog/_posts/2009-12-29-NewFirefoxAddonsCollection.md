It’s been a good year for Firefox and Mozilla. They released the [3.5 version](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/) with lots of improvements. We celebrated [five years](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/5years/en-US/) of Firefox. [Ubiquity](http://ubiquity.mozilla.com/) has become more stable, got lots more of [commands](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Commands_In_The_Wild), [Personas](http://www.getpersonas.com/en-US/) reached the 2.0 milestone and the [Thunderbird 3.0](http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/) looks really great. Firefox 3.5 has become the [most popular browser](http://www.downloadsquad.com/2009/12/21/firefox-3-5-passes-ie7-as-most-poluar-web-browser/) on the web.

To celebrate this year and the one to come, I created a collection of the addons I use on daily basis. Maybe some of them can help you like it help me.

To view the contents of the collection please visit [this page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collection/amreldib2010collection). Here’s a list of the addons in the collection:

##Appearance

[**Strata40**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14284?collection_uuid=88e5ddd4-504b-afac-7ab6-6331c8a6b40a) and [**StrataBuddy**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14762?collection_uuid=88e5ddd4-504b-afac-7ab6-6331c8a6b40a) (Windows Only) gives you the look and feel of the mockups of Firefox 4.0 which makes your browser looks great in Windows 7.

[**Personal Menu**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3895?collection_uuid=88e5ddd4-504b-afac-7ab6-6331c8a6b40a) puts all Firefox menus in one place and hides the menu bar.

[**Fission**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1951?collection_uuid=88e5ddd4-504b-afac-7ab6-6331c8a6b40a) displays the progress bar in the address bar.

##Tabs

**[Tab Progress Bar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14644?collection_uuid=88e5ddd4-504b-afac-7ab6-6331c8a6b40a)** shows a little progress bar in tab header.

**[TabMixPlus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1122?collection_uuid=88e5ddd4-504b-afac-7ab6-6331c8a6b40a)** what can I say. Nothing is like having complete and total control over your browser tabs. Take 20 minutes of your time to go through all the configurations and then export it to a file a keep it in a safe place.

**[TabScope](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4882?collection_uuid=88e5ddd4-504b-afac-7ab6-6331c8a6b40a)** lets you peek at the other tabs that aren’t in focus like Windows live thumbnail for applications in the taskbar. Scroll page in the preview and even click links. You can control the size of the preview.

**[Evernote Web Clipper](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/8381?collection_uuid=88e5ddd4-504b-afac-7ab6-6331c8a6b40a)** if you’re not using Evernote, it’s probably because you’re using OneNote.

[**Clip to OneNote**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/12003?collection_uuid=88e5ddd4-504b-afac-7ab6-6331c8a6b40a) if you’re not using OneNote, it’s because you’re using Evernote.

**[Read it Later](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7661?collection_uuid=88e5ddd4-504b-afac-7ab6-6331c8a6b40a)** this is definitely for work. You mark web pages you’re interested in and then read later at work :)

[**CuteMenus - Crystal SVG**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1330?collection_uuid=88e5ddd4-504b-afac-7ab6-6331c8a6b40a) makes all menus cuter.
