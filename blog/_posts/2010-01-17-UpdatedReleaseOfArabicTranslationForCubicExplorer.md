A year ago, [I released](/CubicExplorerArabicTranslationAvailable/) an Arabic translation for my favorite alternative of Windows Explorer, Cubic Explorer. After a year of updates of the software, I thought the translation might need some updating and I also noticed some mistakes that needed to be fixed.

Now you can get an updated release of the translation (release 1.1). You can find it [here]({{ site.imgFolder_blog }}{{ page.name }}/default.po). This translation works with Cubic Explorer release 0.91.0.1223 (SVN Snapshot) which you can get [here](http://www.cubicreality.com/2010/01/15/notes-week-2-polished-info-bar-and-ces-future/).

Hopefully the updated translation will be included in the installer very soon.

Enjoy.
