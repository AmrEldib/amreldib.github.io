Ever wondered how firefox is still running even though all of Mozilla's products are for free..

First, it must be denotations, the "Best Browser Implementing Web Standards" - according to Mozilla - must be receiving lots of denotations from its wide user base. But There are actually two Mozillas, the Foundation and the Corporation.

The [Foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation) is a non-profit organization that handles the leadership for the open source Mozilla project, the polices, key infrastructure, trademarks and that stuff. Its revenue is tax-exempt status under the U.S. tax code as it's based in Mountain View, California.

The [Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation) is a subsidiary of the foundation that coordinates the development of internet-related applications such as [firefox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox). It also depends on denotations but there's also a deal with Google that whenever a user uses that little search box on the top right and he/she clicks an ad in the search results offered by Google, Mozilla gets 80% of the revenue. That little box is [rumored](http://www.calacanis.com/2006/03/06/firefox-mozilla-corporation-mozilla-foundation-made-72m-last/) to had made $72M last year. It's [confirmed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation) (by Wikipedia, read the Financing section) that $61.5M were Mozilla's revenues in 2006 because of the little box out of a total $66.8M of revenues.

It's good to see Mozilla going strong financially as they are technically. Looks like the red fox is gonna be sticking around for a while.. bad news for the guys in Redmond..
