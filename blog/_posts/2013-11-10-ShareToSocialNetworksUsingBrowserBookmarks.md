I've tried many ways to easily share items from my browser to any of the social networks I'm using. Addons came close to working fine but I always worry (maybe unreasonably) about their load on the browser.

Then, I came across bookmarks (or _bookmarklets_) via a [Scott Hanselman's post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/AddSocialSharingLinksToYourBlogWithoutWidgetJavaScript.aspx) and I found a winner.

Here are the code snippets for how to share to some of the popular social networks. Simply create a bookmark and provide its location to be the code snippet:

## Twitter

## Facebook

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/7297751.js"></script>

## App.Net

<script src="https://gist.github.com/AmrEldib/7297755.js"></script>

## Springpad

## Kindle

To send items to Kindle, use [Klip.me](http://www.klip.me/)
