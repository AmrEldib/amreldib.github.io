From the moment I land on your page, you have about 15-20 seconds to tell me what your project is about.  
I'm willing to spend more time if your project has lots of stars.  
You can really help by:  
- **Have a Descriptive Name**. Ex: FileBrowser. I can understand that, but it's very boring name. So, don't do it, have good description instead.
- **Have a demo page**. I'm willing to spend much more time in the demo page. However, if you're app require some data to make sense, add some sample data. Make it easy to re-load that data if I screw things up and remove it.
- **Add a screenshot**. It's really important for the screenshot to be big and obvious. Either take a screenshot zooming in on a section of your application, or take a screenshot of the whole application, but allow me to view the large version when I click on the image.
- **Add a GIF**. Those are great for explaining killer-features.
- **Add a Video**. Do short vidos. You can do long videos but those are not your introduction of the project. Have a transcript before you start recording the video. Don't introduce yourself, just get to the point.

Items you must cover:
- What is your project?
- Who is this for?
- What are the technologies/platforms that this project is associated with?
	- I don't care what technologies was used to build this project. I care about if I can use it. You have to put up front that this project only works on Commodore 128, so that if I have Commodore 64 I know right away that it's not for me. Add a phrase like "Support for Commodore 64 is coming" if you're working on it. Or, "Support for Commodore 64 is up to popular demand" to get users to ask for it.
	- Further down in the page, write what technologies was used to build this project. That information is useful for people who wants to contribute. They are a much smaller group.
- Why should I use your project and not the other famous one?
	- Your project doesn't exist in a vacuum, and ignoring obvious alternatives will just get users to ignore your project unless they have problems and are looking for a solution.
	- You have to establish that the alternatives have a problem. You can't just say "This tool is faster than tool X". Show some numbers. If you don't have numbers, then say "This tool aims to improve performance compared to tool X by ...." then you explain the genious idea you have for improving performance. This will make readers go: "Oh, if they deliver this, it will be awesome. I should try it".
	- Comparing your project to other projects doesn't have to be a Better/Worse comparison. It can be "Use this for this scenario/Use that for that scenario". Say something like: "This framework aims to be less opionnated than framework Y". Any users with scenarios outside the ones covered by Y are now interested.

Always do this:
- Write in bullet points. Your README is not an essay, it's a collection of information. Break it down to sections. Make the sections stand on their own, so if I skip couple of them, I can make sense on the next one.
