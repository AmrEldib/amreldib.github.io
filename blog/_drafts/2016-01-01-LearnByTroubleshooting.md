 <div lang="zxx" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">As a developer, I have to keep up with the ever changing landscape of programming languages, framework, technologies, techniques, and tools. It's part of how I get to keep my job. On top of that, I'm curios about all kinds of new stuff. So, I like to learn things on my own as well. Over the years, I tried almost everything; offline courses, online/remote courses, video courses, books, blog posts, "30 days of newTechnologyX" blog series, YouTube video series, code katas, peer programming, participating in open source projects, etc. Your list might be longer or shorter but you sure have tried some of these things to various successes.&nbsp;</div><div lang="zxx" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">
</div><div lang="zxx" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Some techniques work for some people and some don't. Not all learnings are the same. We might think they are but they're not. I like to break them down into 4 categories:</div>

*   <div lang="zxx" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">**Learning Concepts**:  think of moving from Windows Forms to WPF, moving from VB6/VBA to  .NET, or starting with AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition). If you  try to move from one "universe" to another without  understanding the basic governing laws of this new universe, you  will be forever lost. No amount of practice or everyday coding will  make up for skipping this introduction. You need to stop and learn  these concepts. Not just learn what the concepts are but also "why"  they are this way. Learning the history of how the  language/tool/technology came to be will make you better at applying  it at the correct use.</div>
*   <div lang="zxx" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Learning New Languages:   </div>
*   <div lang="zxx" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Learning APIs:</div>
*   <div lang="zxx" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Learning Tools:</div>
