Thats another thing actually,<BR/>Libraries in Windows 7 are just aggregating multiple locations of files to one view.<BR/><BR/>While via a Saved Search, where say you ask to display all files with the Tag "Project 12" from year "2008". It would have been nice that when you then save a file to that Saved Search, it applies all the same metadata tags.<BR/><BR/>Again this is something that Windows 7 can't do.<BR/><BR/>RIP WinFS :(
