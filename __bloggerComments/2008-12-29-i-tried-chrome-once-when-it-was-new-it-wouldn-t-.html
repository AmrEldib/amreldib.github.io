I tried Chrome once when it was "new", it wouldn't load any pages and I stopped using it and went back to my lovely Firefox and haven't looked back since.<BR/><BR/>There are however two things I find annoying in Firefox:<BR/> the first is how the "Send Image" is right underneath that "Save Image" menu option. I'm probably the only one who finds this annoying but I'm a chronic image 'holic .. if I come across some gallery of images and before I know it I'm saving pictures, thus i love the DownThemAll Extension ;) but there are some annoying galleries which require me use the old fashioned right click-save and I've more than once or twice slided that mouse over to the email option.<BR/><BR/>the second one is more of a side-effect of my weird browser habits.  It's rare for me to have under 35 tabs open any given moment :),  I usually have between 45-65 open ..  and needless to say Firefox is taking QUITE a lot of memory.. but since I have plenty of it and don't usually run other memory intense programs it doesn't really affect me.
